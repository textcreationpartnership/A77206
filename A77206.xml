            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I Am ſo averſe to all <hi>Controverſies</hi> in general, and particularly to thoſe <hi>leſs momentanous ones,</hi> that are ſtill continued between the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church</hi> and <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters,</hi> that 'tis not without great reluctancy and regret, that I am once more engag'd in 'em by the following <hi>Remarks,</hi> on the late celebrated <hi>Diſcourſe of the Biſhop of</hi> Derry, <hi>concerning the Inventions of Men in the Worſhip of God.</hi> For I look on that revival of theſe Debates amongſt us, which his <hi>Lordſhip's Diſcourſe</hi> has given occaſion for, as very <hi>unſeaſonable</hi> in this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and particularly at this <hi>juncture.</hi> We have here ſo valuable a common <hi>Intereſt</hi> (even a conjunction of our Religious and Civil ones) that requires all our joint endeavours to promote, that we have no need to be diverted from 'em, by awakening any dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant Conteſts about the intereſt of leſſer Opinions and Practices. And this ſeems the more improper at ſuch a <hi>time</hi> when there was a proſpect of a <hi>Parliament</hi> being call'd here, and of the ſame <hi>Bill of Indulgence</hi> for <hi>Proteſtant Diſſenters</hi> coming before 'em, that is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy paſt in <hi>England.</hi> A <hi>Bill</hi> that ſeems moſt neceſſary here to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the Replanting this impoveriſh't and deſolate Kingdom with Proteſtants, by providing that <hi>Legal Security</hi> for all of 'em, that wou'd beget a mutual confidence in each other, facilitate a nearer Union of our Affections, and bind us all in more inviolable duty to their Majeſties; under whoſe Indulgent Government we ſhou'd all enjoy both Protection and Favour. Whereas the renewing theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes has too probable a tendency to put the Spirits of Men into a new <hi>ferment,</hi> in which they will be leſs diſpos'd for ſo calm and peaceable, ſo charitable and healing Counſells. For 'tis rare to find theſe publick Debates ſo manag'd, as not to <hi>widen</hi> Differences rather then <hi>compoſe</hi> 'em and <hi>heighten</hi> rather than <hi>allay</hi> the animoſities of the contending Parties.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:134578:3"/>
            <p>But yet I humbly conceive that his Lordſhip has by this <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> lay'd the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> under an unavoydable neceſſity of reſuming theſe Debates, ſo far as they are handled therein: And accordingly there are two <hi>Reaſons,</hi> that I ſhall offer for the publication of theſe <hi>Remarks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The Proteſtant Diſſenters cou'd not omit this attempt to defend themſelves without betraying both the Intereſt of Truth, and that of their own Innocence and juſt Reputation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For his <hi>Lordſhip's. Diſcourſe</hi> having charg'd us in ſo many Inſtances <hi>with caſting God's own Appointments out of his Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing ſo great a mixture of Human Inventions,</hi> has brought us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this unhappy <hi>Dilemma,</hi> That either we muſt ſeem to <hi>Own</hi> the Truth and Juſtice of ſo heavy a charge by our <hi>Silence:</hi> or if we think our ſelves greatly wrong'd muſt appear, tho unwillingly, and unſeaſonably, in our own <hi>Vindication.</hi> For as the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> by his <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Attempt,</hi> (without any occaſion given him) to diſſeize us of our Spiritual Birthright, (I mean to <hi>exclude us from the Catholick Church</hi>) oblig'd us to aſſert our juſt claim to that invaluable <hi>priviledge;</hi> So by this <hi>New Eſſay</hi> to repreſent our Worſhip as ſo miſerably <hi>corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Human Inventions,</hi> and <hi>diſagreable to the Directions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> he has lay'd us under the ſame obligation, to aſſert it's <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>Conformity</hi> to that ſacred <hi>Rule,</hi> ſo far as we think it unjuſtly accus'd of deviating from it. So that I hope our moderate Conforming Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren (towards whom we bear the moſt charitable diſpoſition) will by no means be offended with us, for our modeſt endeavours, to clear our ſelves from ſo invidious a charge, or to retort it on our Accuſer, where his Arguments are more cogent againſt the practices he undertakes to <hi>defend,</hi> then thoſe he <hi>oppoſes.</hi> Nay we think the <hi>Biſhop</hi> himſelf cannot blame us for this, who has ſo frequently urg'd us to examine what he has alledg'd againſt us; demanded our proof of ſuch Principles as he imputes to us; and hereby ſignifi'd that he expects from us the <hi>Reſult</hi> of our ſerious thoughts on what he has offer'd to our View. So that we cannot refuſe to oblige him herein,
<pb facs="tcp:134578:3"/> without failing of the <hi>reſpect</hi> we owe to his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> as well as the <hi>Juſtice</hi> we owe to <hi>Truth</hi> and to our <hi>Selves.</hi> And even <hi>Charity</hi> it ſelf ſeems to prompt us to it; For as we wou'd be glad to reconcile his <hi>Lordſhip,</hi> and all that applaud his Book, to a more favourable opinion of our <hi>Worſhip,</hi> then is therein ſuggeſted, ſo we are neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in order thereto, to ſhew him thoſe <hi>miſtakes</hi> on which his <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices</hi> againſt it are founded.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Biſhops manner of treating this Subject ſeems too diſingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to paſs without ſome juſt Animadverſions upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis indeed true that his Lordſhip has ſhewn great dexterity of <hi>Wit</hi> in treating of this Controverſy in ſo new a method and <hi>Tour,</hi> as to put the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> on the neceſſity of <hi>defending</hi> themſelves from the force of an Argument, in which they thought hitherto they had rather the advantage of being <hi>Aſſailants.</hi> And he has for the moſt part wrote with an Air of <hi>ſeriouſneſs</hi> and <hi>gravity</hi> becoming the <hi>weight</hi> of the <hi>Subject</hi> as well as the <hi>dignity</hi> of his <hi>Character.</hi> Nor do there want ſome <hi>kind</hi> expreſſions that ſeem to argue, that his former cenſoriouſneſs and rigor is allay'd, ſince in this Diſcourſe he ſo often treats us with the obliging apellation of his <hi>Friends</hi> and his <hi>Brethern.</hi> 'Tis true ſome jealous People think it doubtful, becauſe, tho he call us <hi>Friends</hi> in one place, he ſeems to explain it of <hi>Back-Friends, p.</hi> 169. in another and tho he often ſtyle us his <hi>Brethren</hi> that may be only in the ſame ſenſe as <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Publicans</hi> are, ſince he ſtill ſpeaks of us as <hi>fallen off from the Church,</hi> and disbelieving the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the Goſpel, <hi>p.</hi> 166. But I am willing rather to meaſure his Inclinations by thoſe kind and charitable Words that ſeem to drop from his Pen, when his Thoughts are <hi>cool,</hi> then by thoſe harſher ones that the <hi>heat</hi> of Diſpute may ſuggeſt. Only his <hi>Brethren</hi> wou'd have been greatly ſatisfied, to have found ſome more explicit declaration of his <hi>Charity</hi> by his owning us to be a part of the <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church,</hi> and think he wou'd have beſt conſulted his own reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by repairing the wrong done to ſo many excellent Churches in caſting 'em ſo peremptorely out of it.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:134578:4"/>
            <p>But there are theſe following Inſtances of ſo great <hi>diſingenuity</hi> in his <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> as deſerve ſome juſt Reflections on 'em. As</p>
            <p n="1">1. He has in every part of it run into many <hi>miſtakes</hi> about <hi>matter of Fact,</hi> and ſome of 'em ſo <hi>groſs,</hi> that a very ordinary care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in his Enquiries might have prevented. Nor needed he have gone farther to have rectify'd many of thoſe miſtakes then (not only the Dioceſs, but) the City where he now reſides. And yet in ſome of thoſe <hi>miſtakes</hi> he ſpeaks with ſo great a height of <hi>aſſurance</hi> as is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to poſſeſs all thoſe Readers with the belief of the truth of what he delivers, who take theſe matters on the credit of his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and relation. But 'tis well for us, that the ſtrongeſt Aſſevera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will not change the nature of things, nor weigh down, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſenſe in matters of Fact. And therefore I hope that his Lordſhip will not miſinterpret it as a failure in the deference we owe to his Character, if we call ſuch palpable miſrepreſentations of our <hi>Principles</hi> or <hi>Practices, calumnies,</hi> and urge him either to <hi>prove</hi> or <hi>retract</hi> 'em. For ſure he that unjuſtly <hi>accuſes</hi> others, has no right to blame 'em for telling him that he dos ſo; and cannot expect that thoſe he <hi>accuſes</hi> ſhould out of exceſs of Civility and Complement ſeem to countenance his groundleſs Accuſations by a cold and faint denyal, and forbear to manifeſt their own Innocence for fear of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing thereby the Reputation of their Reverend Accuſer. And therefore, if the <hi>charge</hi> of <hi>injuſtice</hi> and <hi>wrong</hi> done us, in his accounts of us, that ſo often occurs in theſe <hi>Remarks,</hi> may ſeem <hi>harſh</hi> and <hi>ſevere,</hi> he muſt thank himſelf for it, and has no ground to complain if the <hi>charge</hi> it ſelf be true.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He has taken occaſion from ſuch palpable <hi>miſtakes</hi> in matters of Fact, to faſten upon us the moſt <hi>invidious,</hi> but the moſt <hi>unjuſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,</hi> tho guilded over with ſmooth and ſpecious language (like <hi>bitter Pills</hi> cover'd with <hi>Leaf Gold</hi>) to make 'em go the more eaſily down. And of theſe ſo many will occur under each <hi>Chapter</hi> as will ſuperſede the neceſſity of mentioning 'em here.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb facs="tcp:134578:4"/>3. Where he miſtakes our <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices,</hi> he frequently feignes a great many <hi>Reaſons,</hi> as alledg'd by us in defence of thoſe he groundleſsly imputes to us, and ſpends a great part of his <hi>Book</hi> in confutation of 'em; whereby his ignorant Readers that take theſe matters on truſt from him are tempted to imagine he is <hi>confuting us,</hi> when he is only <hi>fighting with his own ſhadow,</hi> and anſwering <hi>Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which himſelf dos not pretend to produce any <hi>Author</hi> for. See the Chapter of <hi>Prayer,</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 57. to <hi>p.</hi> 67. See the Chapter of <hi>Hearing,</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 86. to <hi>p.</hi> 101. See the Chapter of <hi>Bodily Worſhip,</hi> from <hi>p.</hi> 130. to <hi>p.</hi> 142.</p>
            <p>Now I take this method of treating ſuch <hi>Controverſies,</hi> wherein the reputation of a great body of Proteſtants are concern'd, to be ſo highly <hi>diſingenuous,</hi> that as ſuch Authors deſerve a gentle Reproof, ſo 'tis neceſſary out of regard to <hi>charity</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> it ſelf to obviate the pernicious influence of ſuch <hi>Writings.</hi> For ſuch <hi>Writings</hi> tend to make <hi>differences</hi> between us ſeem <hi>greater</hi> then they are, and to <hi>exaſperate</hi> rather then <hi>heal</hi> the Wounds caus'd by 'em. Whereas a contrary, judicious, and fair ſtating of <hi>Controverſies</hi> tends to narrow 'em, and ſeldom fails to bring the contending parties to a nearer agreement of <hi>Judgment</hi> as well as <hi>Affection.</hi> And this I can truly profeſs to be the principal deſign of theſe <hi>Remarks.</hi> And tho I am conſcious of the weakneſs of my own abilities for ſuch an undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yet I am not, of any inclination to ſet <hi>Proteſtants</hi> at a greater diſtance from one another. On the contrary, I ſhall think my time in writing theſe <hi>Remarks</hi> well employ'd, if they contribute any thing to reconcile ſober <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to more favourable and charitable thoughts of thoſe different <hi>modes of worſhip</hi> that yet remain among 'em, and to convince 'em how little theſe <hi>differences</hi> ſhou'd ſignify to <hi>abate</hi> our <hi>eſteem</hi> and <hi>love</hi> for ſuch who are agreed with us in thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>Having truly propos'd what were my inducements to publiſh theſe <hi>Remarks,</hi> I ſhall only add one Obſervation neceſſary to prevent miſtakes, <hi>viz.</hi> That the matters treated on in this <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> of the <hi>Bp's</hi> are by no means the main hing on which the <hi>Controverſy</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Eſtabliſh't Church</hi> and the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> turns.

But none can blame his Lordſhips prudence in chooſing a <hi>Poſt</hi> which he thought himſelf moſt capable to <hi>make good.</hi> And if he not only <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend</hi> that, but in a reſolute <hi>ſally</hi> ſeize ſome of the Enemys <hi>Canon</hi> and turn it againſt themſelves, It muſt be own'd for a conſiderable <hi>Service.</hi> No doubt he ſuppoſes he has done ſo; how juſtly, I ſhall leave to the Reader's unbyaſt Judgment when he has perus'd theſe <hi>Remarks,</hi> in which I ſhall trace his <hi>Lordſhips</hi> ſteps in the clear and accurate method he has lay'd down.</p>

            <head>Remarks upon the Introduction.</head>
            <p>UPon the Review of the Introduction, and comparing it with the following Chapters, I was greatly ſurpriz'd to find theſe 3 unuſual and palpable defects in it, than which, I ſcarce know 3 more inexcuſable ones a Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter can be guilty of, that pretends to treat a controverſial ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Tho he ſtiles his Book, <hi>A Diſcourſe concerning the Inventions of men in the Worſhip of God,</hi> Yet he has not in all thoſe 188 pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, of which it conſiſts, ſo much as once ſtated the true notion of 'em, or told us what he means by 'em. A ſtrange overſight in one that pretends to have ſo <hi>carefully examin'd</hi> this matter, and has ſaid ſo many things relating to it, which he cou'd not but foreſee wou'd fall under the critical examination of thoſe on whoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and practices he has made ſo many and ſevere Reflections; eſpecially when he cou'd not well be ignorant that the ſubject he undertakes to diſcourſe on is very <hi>ambiguous,</hi> and capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken in ſo different ſenſes. But 'tis eaſy to gheſs what kind of <hi>ſuperſtructure</hi> he is like to raiſe, when he has forgot to lay the <hi>foundation.</hi> So that we are oblig'd to deſire his Lordſhip to write another Diſcourſe to ſtate the Queſtion; that we may know what the Arguments in this are levelled for, or againſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But there is a worſe fault this Diſcourſe is chargeable with, <hi>viz.</hi> That as far as his Lp's meaning can be gather'd from his words, he has given us 2 inconſiſtent Notions of <hi>human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions</hi> in the Worſhip of God, which yet he has taken no care to diſtinguiſh, and tell us fairly when he intends the one, and when the other.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:134578:7"/>
            <p>Sometimes by the <hi>Inventions of men</hi> in the Worſhip of God, he ſeems to underſtand ſome things relating either to the <hi>matter,</hi> or the <hi>manner</hi> of Religious Worſhip, that are unlawful and ſinful. Thus in his firſt Paragraph, <hi>Our bleſsed Saviour</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>has taught us that there are ſome ways of worſhipping God which have ſo great a mixture of human Invention in 'em, that they are vain and unacceptable to him,</hi> for which he quotes 7 <hi>Mark</hi> 7. A paſſage which (as I ſhall ſhew anon) plainly refers to thoſe Jewiſh Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which our Saviour there arraigns as guilty of ſinful ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. And again in his principles, <hi>p.</hi> 3. he ſeems to lay down his Notion of the Inventions of men in the worſhip of God, when he there tells us, <hi>That ſince God has given us a certain direction for his Worſhip in the H. Scriptures, It is to be ſuppos'd that all ways of Worſhip are diſpleaſing to him, that are not expreſly contain'd, or war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by Examples of H. men mention'd therein.</hi> 'Tis true indeed, that if he intend this for a deſcription of ſuch <hi>human Inventions,</hi> we are not much the wiſer for it, (as I ſhall obſerve afterwards). But this we may certainly inferr from it, that he underſtands by 'em ſuch <hi>ways of Worſhip</hi> as are <hi>diſpleaſing to God,</hi> becauſe deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of ſcriptural <hi>Prec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pt</hi> and <hi>Pattern.</hi> Now I wou'd intreat his Lordſhip to acquaint us how we ſhall reconcile this with his own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch things to be <hi>lawful,</hi> to which this very notion of <hi>human Inventions</hi> do's agree, and which he calls by that very name. To give him an Inſtance in his firſt Chapter about <hi>Pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe.</hi> He there charges the Diſſenters way of praiſing God by <hi>ſinging Pſalms in metre</hi> as deſtitute of all <hi>Command</hi> or <hi>Precedent</hi> from the Scripture, and as a <hi>purely human Invention, p.</hi> 24. And yet in the very begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Section that concerns the Diſſenters manner of Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God, <hi>he deſires us to obſerve, for preventing miſtakes, that he do's not condemn the ſinging Pſalms in Metre as unlawful.</hi> And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, when he foreſaw that he muſt otherwiſe have condemn'd what is practis'd in the Pariſh-Churches; For tho he tells us this is but a voluntary entertainment of devotion in their publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, yet there were all poſſible reaſon to caſt it out, if it were a ſinful way of praiſing God according to the firſt Notion of <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:134578:7"/> Inventions.</hi> 'Tis evident then that he ſometimes underſtands by <hi>human Inventions</hi> ſome ſinful ways of Worſhip, ſometimes ſuch innocent modes of it as are of human determination. Nay, ſo <hi>jumbled</hi> are his notions of this matter, that tho he own <hi>Sermons</hi> to have the warrant of ſcriptural <hi>Example,</hi> yet he ranks 'em among the <hi>Inventions of men, p</hi> 102. And this uncertain ſenſe of this ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery phraſe breeds ſo miſerable a confuſion in his whole diſcourſe, that when he tells us ſo often of our <hi>human Inventions,</hi> we are at a loſs whether he ſpeak it by way of <hi>applauſe</hi> or <hi>cenſure,</hi> whether he <hi>commend our uſe of Chriſtian prudence,</hi> or <hi>arraign us as guilty of ſuperſtition.</hi> But</p>
            <p n="3">3. I have a ſeverer Reflection yet to add, <hi>viz.</hi> That his Lp. has made this ſtrange confuſion in his own Notions about <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Inventions,</hi> the ground of the moſt uncharitable cenſures of the Worſhip of his Brethren.</p>
            <p>He do's indeed in ſome caſes accuſe the Diſſenters of <hi>laying aſide the commands of God</hi> relating to his Worſhip (how juſtly, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear hereafter). But I never find in his charge of <hi>human Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> that his premiſes amount to any more than ſome modes of Worſhip in general neceſſary, but in particular left to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of human prudence; And yet in his <hi>Concluſion</hi> he wou'd inſinuate into his unwary Readers, as if he had prov'd our Worſhip guilty of ſuch <hi>ſuperſtitious Inventions,</hi> as our Saviour's words, 7 <hi>Mark</hi> 7. caution us againſt. And ſo many Inſtances of this kind will occurr in the examination of the particular Chapters, as will ſpare me the labour of mentioning 'em here. I ſhall therefore here only add, That if this thin ſophiſm impos'd on his own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, 'tis great pitty he ſhou'd trouble the world with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing a debate concerning theſe things, before he had better di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted his thoughts about 'em; If it did not, where was his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity in founding ſo heavy an Indictment on ſuch proof as he knew was ſo lame and inconſiſtent?</p>
            <p>Leaſt therefore theſe Remarks ſhou'd be guilty of the ſame faults with his Lordſhip's Diſcourſe, It will be neceſſary to ſet
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:134578:8"/> theſe matters in a clearer light, which he has ſo ſtudiouſly wrapt up in perfect obſcurity.</p>
            <p n="1">I. This Phraſe of the <hi>Inventions of men,</hi> as relating to the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God,</hi> occurrs <hi>thrice</hi> in our Tranſlation of the Bible, <hi>viz.</hi> 106 <hi>Pſ.</hi> 29. &amp; 39 <hi>v.</hi> and 99 <hi>Pſ.</hi> 8 <hi>v.</hi> In the firſt place, 'tis applied to the people of Iſrael's <hi>joyning in the ſacrifices offer'd to Baal-peor;</hi> In the 2d, 'tis applied to their imitating the Heatheniſh Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in that horrid wickedneſs of <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing their children to Idols.</hi> In the 3d, 'tis moſt probable by the Context, that the expreſſion referrs to the Worſhip of God by the <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> as an Image or ſymbol of his preſence. So that if we borrow our Notion of <hi>human Inventions</hi> in Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip from the ſcriptural uſe of that phraſe, they always imply a violation either of the <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>ſecond</hi> Command, either by ſetting up a wrong <hi>Object</hi> of Worſhip, or a forbidden and corrupt <hi>way</hi> of paying our worſhip to the true Object of it. And if the Biſhop had prov'd the Worſhip of Diſſenters guilty of ſuch <hi>human Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> he had done ſomething to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But if we derive our Notion of the <hi>Inventions of men</hi> in the Worſhip of God, from that paſſage of our Saviour which the <hi>Biſhop</hi> cites from <hi>Mark</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>In vain do ye worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines the commandments of men,</hi> a little care in examining it, will eaſily help us to ſtate it right.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Commandments of men</hi> our Saviour here plainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands ſuch, as enjoyn'd the doing or forbearing certain things as inſtances of Piety and Holineſs that recommend us to God, which he never preſcrib'd in the law of nature, or in his ſupernatural Revelation. Such Commandments of men he aſſerts thoſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions among the Jews to be, that plac'd ſo much of holineſs in waſhing their hands before eating, or when they came from pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of publick converſe, as if this external cleanneſs cou'd recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend 'em to the infinitely pure eyes of the great God. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch Inſtances of Apocryphal ſanctity occurr in the lives of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:134578:8"/> Popiſh Saints, who plac'd ſo much of it in ſo many unneceſſary Auſterities, and other trifling Fopperies. And no wonder our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſhou'd condemn ſuch human Traditions as thus tend to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt our apprehenſions of the nature and will of God, and poſſeſs us with ſuch a falſe idea of true Religion, as adulterates the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of it.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſuperſtitious Precepts of men receive an Additional Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation, when the obſerving 'em neceſſitates the violation of the Laws of God, Thus our Saviour arraigns the ſuperſtitious Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Jewiſh Doctors about the obligation of <hi>raſh Vows,</hi> which entangl'd 'em in the breach of the 5th <hi>Command,</hi> 7 <hi>Mark</hi> 11. And on the ſame account we condemn thoſe raſh vows of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libacy</hi> in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> which ſo often involve thoſe that make 'em in the violation of the 7th.</p>
            <p>Now if we apply this ſenſe of the <hi>Commandments of Men</hi> to the Worſhip of God, we ſhall have a clear Notion of ſuch <hi>human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions</hi> as this Text do's condemn, As,</p>

For tho God has commanded publick <hi>Pray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r, Praiſe, Hearing, Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord's Supper, &amp;c.</hi> Yet what time or place we ſhall aſſemble in, In what order theſe parts of Worſhip ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, What particular devout poſture we ſhall uſe among ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral equally expreſſive of our religious Reverence, what Tranſlation of the Bible or Verſion of the Pſalms we ſhall chooſe, what portion of the Scriptures ſhall be read, explain'd and apply'd; What uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils ſhall be employ'd in the celebration of the Sacraments, and a multitude of ſuch circumſtances and modes of that kind are left to human Determination. Only therein the general Rules of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt be regarded, as <hi>That all be done to Edification, and all things be done decently and in order,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26, v. 40. Now to call ſuch modes of Worſhip thus juſtly determin'd by human Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the <hi>Inventions of Men,</hi> even ſuch as our Saviour refers to 7 <hi>Mark</hi> 7. is indeed common enough with ſuch wild Sectaries, as the <hi>Quakers;</hi> but I am ſorry that his Lp. ſhou'd thus eſpouſe their Quarrel, and take up their Arguments againſt us. And yet I hope to make it evident, That his Proof of <hi>human Inventions</hi> in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Diſſenters amounts to no more then ſuch <hi>prudential human Orders</hi> about the modes of Worſhip, as are undoubtedly allowable
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:134578:10"/> and lawfull; and That the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church</hi> is much more liable to the ſame charge, many of whoſe Practices as well as thoſe of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> I ſhall be oblig'd in charity to defend from this weak and blind Accuſation.</p>
            <p>What I have here ſuggeſted will make it needleſs to take any farther notice of the <hi>Principles</hi> his Lp. lays down in reference to the VVorſhip of God, then to annex theſe few brief <hi>Remarks</hi> on 'em.</p>
            <p>For the 2 firſt, <hi>That it belongs to God only to give Rules how he will be worſhip't, and that the H. Scriptures contain the Revelation of God's Will concerning his Worſhip,</hi> They are no other then what will freely be granted him, unleſs he extend 'em to all <hi>circumſtances</hi> and <hi>modes</hi> of VVorſhip and exclude all human Prudence in the determination of 'em.</p>
            <p>For the 3d. which he infers from the 2 former, viz. <hi>That it concerns us to keep as cloſe as we can to thoſe Directions which God has been pleas'd to afford us in his Word, without adding to, omitting or altering any thing that he has there laid down.</hi> I hope he intends no more by it, then that ſo far as God has by thoſe Directions enjoyn'd any part of Worſhip, or expreſly determin'd the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and circumſtances of it, ſo far we muſt follow ſuch <hi>Directions;</hi> And therefore I hope he wou'd not hereby inſinuate as if thoſe <hi>Directions</hi> were ſo particular, as to appoint all the fore mentioned circumſtantial modes of Inſtituted worſhip. And I think this Caution the more needfull to be given him, becauſe the Reaſon he offers for this <hi>Principle</hi> carrys a very uncertain and dangerous ſound with it, viz. <hi>For ſince God his vouchſaft us a certain Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for his Worſhip in the H. Scriptures, It is to be ſuppos'd that all ways of Worſhip are diſpleaſing to him, that are not expreſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd or warranted by Examples of H. M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n therein.</hi> If his Lp. had deſign'd our Inſtruction by theſe <hi>Principles,</hi> he ſhou'd not have deliver'd 'em to us (like the <hi>Heathen Oracles</hi>) in ſo <hi>ambiguous</hi> terms, as leave us to gheſs in the dark what he means. For how ſhall we know. Whether by God's giving us a <hi>certain Direction</hi> for his Worſhip, he means as to all the <hi>parts</hi> of it, or all the <hi>circumſtantial modes,</hi> and whether of theſe he intends by <hi>ways of Worſhip.</hi> For if
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:134578:10"/> he intend the <hi>latter,</hi> (as any man wou'd imagine by the whole tenour of his following Diſcourſe, wherein be ſo often applys that phraſe, the <hi>ways of Worſhip</hi> to the <hi>modes</hi> of it) viz. <hi>That God has given us ſo certain a Direction for his Worſhip, as to all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial modes of it, that all ſuch modes of it are diſpleaſing to him that have not expreſs Scripture-Precept or Pattern,</hi> This is ſo <hi>wild</hi> an Aſſertion, that I ſcarce think any more extravagant one ever dropt from the pen of the moſt weak and ſcrupulous <hi>Sectaries,</hi> and ſo very <hi>uncharitable,</hi> that if a man believ'd it, he wou'd find it hard to joyn in any Religious Aſſembly that I know of in the Chriſtian World, I am ſure he muſt renounce all Communion with the Pariſh-Churches; ſo fatal is it to great Wits to run into extremes, that his Lp. is not content with eſpouſing the <hi>Diſſenters Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> without <hi>overdoing,</hi> and ſtretching 'em beyond all tolerable bounds; ſo that if he ſhou'd ever become a Proſelyte to that Party, I am afraid hee'll turn one of thoſe rigid ones that were formerly call'd <hi>Browniſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For what he calls his 4th and 5th <hi>Principle,</hi> I know of no Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute there is about 'em.</p>
            <p>But I muſt crave leave in order to the clearing my way to the following Chapters, to ſubjoyn 2 <hi>Principles</hi> or <hi>Poſtulata</hi> which his Lp. ſeems to have forgot, but are highly neceſſary to a right Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning theſe matters, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Where God has enjoyn'd any part of Religious Worſhip in general, but has not determin'd the particular mode and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of it, There the determination of 'em belongs to <hi>human prudence,</hi> and ſuch determinations of 'em are lawful and warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table as are agreeable to the general Rules of Scripture given to direct us therein. And therefore there may be various <hi>modes</hi> of performing the ſame Religious duty, that are each allowable and lawful; tho ſome particular circumſtances may make <hi>one</hi> to ſome perſons more expedient than the <hi>other. Ex. gr.</hi> God has comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us to pray, but he has no where expreſly determin'd (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his Lp. ſeems to inſinuate to the contrary) whether we ſhall pray <hi>with</hi> or <hi>without</hi> a <hi>ſett Form of words;</hi> both <hi>ways</hi> of praying
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:134578:11"/> therefore may be lawful in general, tho particular circumſtances may to ſome render the <hi>one</hi> or the <hi>other</hi> way more convenient; nay the general Rule of doing all to Edification, may perhaps in ſome caſes oblige men to the <hi>one,</hi> and in ſome to the <hi>other.</hi> I might ſay the ſame concerning ſinging in <hi>Proſe</hi> or <hi>Meetre, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> a <hi>larger</hi> entire portion of Scripture <hi>without Expoſition,</hi> or a <hi>leſser with it, &amp;c.</hi> So that in theſe caſes wiſe men are very cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious on what grounds they go, when they cenſure the Worſhip of others as unlawful, or charge it with ſinful <hi>human Inventions;</hi> and confident Accuſers do but uſually betray their own Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We that are Chriſtians, ſhou'd chiefly attend to the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Examples</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> for our direction in the Worſhip of God. For thoſe of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> no farther concern us, than as any <hi>Rules</hi> deliver'd there belong to the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> and the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of ſuch <hi>Examples</hi> equally extends to us as it did to them. And indeed to urge the <hi>Precepts</hi> or <hi>Patterns</hi> of the Worſhip us'd under the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> any farther, were to bring us again under the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Pedagogy.</p>
            <p>And as I hope, None will deny me theſe 2 reaſonable <hi>Poſtulata,</hi> ſo the uſefulneſs of 'em in theſe Enquiries will appear in many of the <hi>Remarks</hi> on the following Chapters, which I ſhall now ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs my ſelf to the conſideration of.</p>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to the <hi>Directions of the H. Scriptures</hi> concerning this part of Divine VVorſhip, I ſhall offer what follows as the Reſult of the moſt diligent Enquiry I cou'd make, and hope 'tis a juſter as well as clearer Account than that his Lp. has given.</p>
            <p>There are but theſe 2 ways of offering our publick <hi>Praiſes</hi> to God enjoyn'd in the <hi>New Teſtament, viz.</hi> either by <hi>Singing Pſalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs;</hi> or by <hi>Thanksgiving without vocal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. As to <hi>Thanksgiving without vocal Melody,</hi> I wou'd obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. VVe have moſt expreſs command for it as one principal ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted part of our publick VVorſhip. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, <hi>I exhort therefore, that firſt of all Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſion, and</hi> giving of thanks <hi>be made for all men, &amp;c.</hi> And this part of VVorſhip was uſually joyn'd with that of <hi>Prayer.</hi> Thus 4 <hi>Phil.</hi> 6. <hi>In every thing by prayer and ſupplication with</hi> thanksgiving, <hi>let your requeſts be made known to God.</hi> So 4 <hi>Col.</hi> 2. — 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.17, 18. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> or <hi>Giving of Thanks</hi> is mention'd as one ſtated part of the <hi>Devotions</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Aſſemblies,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 16. And that thoſe <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> were different from <hi>Pſalms</hi> or <hi>Songs</hi> is hence evident, both becauſe they were to be varied according to their different occaſions for 'em from the mercies they daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, which ſuch <hi>Pſalms</hi> or <hi>Songs</hi> cou'd not be, (For thoſe are always ſuppos'd to be a ſett invariable form of words); and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ordinarily intermixt with publick Prayer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For the matter of theſe <hi>Publick Thanksgivings,</hi> the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament</hi> chiefly directs us to inſiſt on thoſe peculiar mercies of God to us thro a Mediator, which the Goſpel moſt clearly reveals to us, and of which there is either none, or but very obſcure mention made in any Forms of <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> recorded in the <hi>Old.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if we go thro all the ſolemn <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> that occur in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> we ſhall find 'em to run in a ſtrain as much ſublimer than that of thoſe in the <hi>Old,</hi> as that <hi>clearer</hi> tranſcends that <hi>obſcurer Revelation.</hi> How ſutable to the Evangelical diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is that <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> of the Ap. <hi>Paul?</hi> 1 <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.4, 5, <hi>&amp;c. Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Christ, who has bleſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:134578:12"/> us with all ſpiritual Bleſsings in heavenly things in Chriſt, According as he hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we ſhou'd be holy and blameleſs before him in love, Having predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated us to the Adoption of children by Chriſt to himſelf, &amp;c.</hi> Or <hi>that</hi> of the ſame <hi>Inſpired Writer,</hi> 1 <hi>Col.</hi> 12, 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of the ſame ſtrain is that of the Ap. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 1 <hi>Ch.</hi> 3, 4, <hi>&amp;c. Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who according to his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant mercy has begotten us again to a lively hope by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, to an Inheritance incorruptible, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil'd, and that never fades away, reſerv'd in Heaven for us, &amp;c.</hi> See 1 <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.6. <hi>unto him that lov'd us, and waſh't us from our Sins in his own Blood, and hath made us Kings and Prieſts to God, &amp;c.</hi> 5 Rev. 13, 14, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe are certainly the beſt <hi>Patterns</hi> after which our publick <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> in <hi>Chriſtian Aſſemblies</hi> ſhou'd be drawn. And no <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> recorded in the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> do ſo expreſly and clearly mention theſe ineſtimable bleſſings of the New-Covenant, or the matchleſs love of our God and Saviour in the manner of conferring 'em, as theſe recorded in the <hi>New;</hi> and conſequently our <hi>praiſes</hi> ſhou'd ordinarily, as to the very matter of 'em, greatly differ from, and go beyond thoſe us'd in the <hi>Jewiſh Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. We read of no other part the people had in theſe publick <hi>thanksgivings</hi> in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> more than their adding their <hi>Amen</hi> to 'em. So much theſe words of the Ap. <hi>Paul</hi> imply, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.16. <hi>Elſe when thou ſhalt bleſs with the Spirit, how ſhall he that occupies the room of the unlearned ſay Amen at thy giving of thanks.</hi> All Expoſitors on the place refer it to the cuſtom of the peoples ſaying <hi>Amen</hi> at the end of <hi>publick prayers</hi> and <hi>praiſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> I might produce the teſtimony of <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> and other ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Writers of the 3 firſt <hi>Centuries</hi> to this purpoſe; but ſince the <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſeems to allow this Expoſition, <hi>p.</hi> 42. I need inſiſt no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on it here.</p>
            <p>And 'tis the more requiſite to take notice of this <hi>way</hi> of <hi>prayſing</hi> God by <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> without vocal melody, becauſe the <hi>Bp.</hi> ſeems to confound it with that other <hi>way</hi> of <hi>prayſing</hi> God with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:134578:52"/> 
               <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and from which 'tis plainly diſtinguiſh'd. And this leads me to conſider.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>Prayſes</hi> the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> requires us to offer unto God by <hi>Singing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what was to be thus ſung, we may learn from thoſe 2 paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the Ap. <hi>Paul</hi> cited by the Biſhop, 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 19. and 3 <hi>Col.</hi> 16. viz. <hi>Pſalms, Hymns and ſpiritual Songs,</hi> or <hi>Odes.</hi> On which paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges I wou'd make the following Remarks.</p>
            <p>I do fully agree with the Biſhop that this Paſſage of the Apoſtle's do's warrant our uſe of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> in our publick <hi>praiſes,</hi> becauſe 'tis highly probable the word <hi>Pſalms</hi> refers to 'em. But then I muſt add, 'tis no leſs probable that the Apoſtle do's by <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual ſongs</hi> intend others beſides thoſe of H. <hi>David,</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuch as contain matter of <hi>praiſe</hi> more entirely ſuited to the ſtate of the chriſtian Church under this clearer Light of the Goſpel; As there are many ſolemn <hi>thanksgivings</hi> in many places of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> eaſily capable of being turn'd into <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Odes</hi> by being adapted to this uſe of ſinging 'em. And I ſee no reaſon to doubt but this paſſage do's as fully Warrant our compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and uſing ſuch, as it dos the uſe of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David.</hi> So that the want of 'em ſeems to be one defect in this part of Worſhip both among Conf's and NC's, tho ſome of the latter have of late reform'd it by the frequent uſe of <hi>New Teſtament Hymns</hi> in their Congregations, eſpecially in the celebration of the <hi>Lord's Supper.</hi> There are indeed Anthems ſomtimes ſung in the Cathedrals, but 'tis in a way wherein the body of the People cannot joyn with 'em.</p>
            <p n="2">2 But the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> recommends no other uſe of Pſalms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the publick <hi>Praiſes</hi> of God, beſides that of <hi>Singing</hi> 'em.</p>
            <p>The uſe of 'em is no where enjoyn'd in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> but in thoſe places forequoted 5 <hi>Eph.</hi> 19. and 3 <hi>Col.</hi> 16. and 5 <hi>James</hi> 13. and all thoſe directions require the <hi>Singing</hi> 'em. That grace where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we muſt <hi>make Melody to the Lord in our hearts</hi> preſuppoſes ſome <hi>Melody</hi> made with our <hi>Voices</hi> to which the other ſhou'd cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:134578:53"/>
            <p>And there ſeems to be this obvious Reaſon why <hi>Singing</hi> 'em is ſo expreſly there enjoyn'd, becauſe in that Religious duty thus or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, Nature aſſiſts grace, and our delight in vocal harmony tends to elevate our affections more eaſily towards their bleſſed Object. So that we neither comply with the Apoſtles precept, nor indeed with the reaſon of it, by barely repeating or <hi>ſaying</hi> ſuch <hi>Pſalms, Hymns</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Songs</hi> without <hi>ſinging</hi> 'em (except when we only read 'em for Inſtruction, without uſing 'em as Forms of Praiſe). Nor has the Bp. produc'd any example of ſuch <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Hymns</hi> being <hi>ſaid,</hi> as contra-diſtinguiſht from being <hi>ſung.</hi> For the 118 Pſ. 2. he dos well not to inſiſt on it to this purpoſe. For it no more proves our being requir'd to <hi>ſay</hi> Pſalms, as diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht from <hi>ſinging</hi> 'em, than the word <hi>ſaying</hi> proves it, when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to that <hi>New Song</hi> which is expreſly ſaid to be <hi>ſung,</hi> 5 <hi>Rev</hi> 9. He tells us indeed that we find in Scripture ſeveral ſacred <hi>Hymns,</hi> particularly of <hi>Hannah,</hi> the <hi>B. Virgin, Zacharias,</hi> &amp; <hi>Simeon,</hi> and the Saints in Heaven, 7 <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. &amp; 11.17. <hi>which are ſaid to have been ſaid by 'em reſpectively, and the circumſtances of the ſtory do not make it probable that they were ſung.</hi> Anſw. 'Tis true indeed, we commonly call theſe paſſages <hi>Hymns,</hi> becauſe they are eaſily ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being turn'd into <hi>Hymns.</hi> But we do ſo improperly, For 'tis certain the Scripture never gives 'em that Title, but appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priates it to what was <hi>ſung.</hi> What <hi>Hannah</hi> ſpake is call'd a <hi>Prayer,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 1. That ſolemn Thanksgiving aſcrib'd to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> has no Title given, (or if it was a Song, there is as much evidence of its being <hi>ſung,</hi> as of its being only <hi>ſaid). Zacharias</hi>'s <hi>thanksgiving</hi> is call'd <hi>propheſying,</hi> 1 <hi>Luke</hi> 67. <hi>Simeon</hi>'s is call'd <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (the word us'd for <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.16.) The 7 <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. — and 11.17. are plainly <hi>Thanksgivings.</hi> Since then the Bp. has not produc'd one Inſtance of <hi>Pſalms, Hymns,</hi> or <hi>Spiritual Songs</hi> that were <hi>ſaid,</hi> as diſtinguiſht from being <hi>ſung,</hi> 'tis evident this uſe of 'em in the praiſes of God is unſcriptural, and is far from having either precept or pattern in the Bible to warrant it; and if we judge of it by the Bp's own Principles, we muſt pronounce it unlawful: Nay, 'tis the more to be ſuſpected,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:134578:53"/> becauſe it croſſes the only direction given us about the uſe of 'em in this part of publick VVorſhip.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Since the New Teſtament requires our Praiſing God pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly by ſinging <hi>Pſalms, Hymns,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Songs,</hi> it dos fully warrant us to adapt the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> to that uſe by turning 'em into <hi>metre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For 'tis one great general Rule of Scripture, that all things in publick Worſhip <hi>ſhou'd be done to Edification,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 26. 'Tis evidently moſt conducive to Edification, that the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation joyn in the praiſes of God by <hi>ſinging Pſalms</hi> (according to his Appointment in the places fore-mention'd). But this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without turning 'em into <hi>metre,</hi> becauſe the generality of the people cannot ſing 'em in <hi>proſe,</hi> but muſt if they <hi>ſing</hi> 'em, have 'em accommodated to that uſe by ſuch <hi>meaſures</hi> as are familiar to 'em. And the addition of <hi>Rhime</hi> is but a convenient condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion herein to the weakneſs of the people, to whom <hi>Verſe</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it is, thro cuſtom, become leſs grateful; (even as thoſe conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the help of our weak memories, who firſt divided the <hi>Bible</hi> into <hi>Chapters</hi> and <hi>Verſes</hi>). So that theſe circumſtances plainly fall under the determination of human prudence, and are accordingly determin'd very agreeably to that general Rule I cited before. And I may juſtly add, that the <hi>Pſalms</hi> thus tranſlated into <hi>Metre</hi> (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the true ſenſe of the Inſpired Writer be deliver'd) are as truly the <hi>Word of God,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalms</hi> tranſlated into <hi>proſe;</hi> And we are as much oblig'd to turn the <hi>Pſalms</hi> into <hi>metre</hi> for this uſe of <hi>ſinging</hi> 'em, as to traſlate 'em out of Hebrew-<hi>metre</hi> into <hi>proſe</hi> for our <hi>Reading</hi> and <hi>Inſtruction.</hi> For they can no more ſerve the uſe of being generally <hi>ſung</hi> without the <hi>one,</hi> than that of being <hi>read</hi> for Inſtruction without the <hi>other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis highly probable that the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in <hi>metre,</hi> quite contrary to what the Bp. ſo frequently ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts, <hi>p.</hi> 5.9.21.</p>
            <p>'Tis indeed true that we are now very unable to give an exact Account of it. And 'tis no wonder, when our knowledge of the Hebrew Language is ſo imperfect, and the diſtance of time ſo
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:134578:54"/> very great. But if we will credit thoſe who were more capable to judge of that matter, by having the advantage of us in both theſe reſpects, we muſt diſſent from his Lp's opinion in it. For that grave Hiſtorian <hi>Joſephus</hi> aſſures us, <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. that <hi>the Pſalms</hi> were <hi>wrote in various ſorts of metre,</hi> of which he mentions two, ſome <hi>Trimeters,</hi> and ſome <hi>Pentameters.</hi> And indeed this is ſo plain of ſome of 'em, as particularly the 111th and 112th, that all Expoſitors take notice of the <hi>meaſures</hi> that plainly appear in 'em, and there can be no reaſonable doubt about it. Every verſe having in the beginning and middle 2 letters in order of the <hi>Hebrew Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet,</hi> only the 2 laſt have each 3 letters, tho the <hi>meaſures</hi> are even in them alike with the others. There is no leſs appearance of <hi>metre</hi> in the 119th <hi>Pſalm,</hi> as all <hi>Critics</hi> obſerve upon it. See the learned <hi>Gataker</hi>'s account of the ſeveral <hi>Tunes</hi> to which the Pſalms were ſuited, and the manner of ſinging 'em in his <hi>Cinnus.</hi> And if the Pſalms were compos'd in <hi>metre,</hi> that they might be <hi>ſung,</hi> 'Tis certainly moſt agreeable to the example of Scripture to turn 'em into <hi>metre</hi> for the ſame end and uſe.</p>
            <p n="3">III. For <hi>Reſponſes,</hi> There is no doubt that in ſuch places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as the Bp. has alledg'd, (7 <hi>Rev.</hi> from the 9th to the 13th. (Tho in the paraphraſing this Text, 7 <hi>Rev.</hi> 11, 12. his Lp. commits an odd miſtake in ſuppoſing the Angels and Elders to joyn in ſaying what we read, <hi>v.</hi> 12. whereas 'tis the Angels alone to whom that part belongs, tho they ſtood about the Throne, and about the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and the 4 Beaſts. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) 19 <hi>Rev.</hi> The inſtance of <hi>Miriam,</hi> The 24th. and 118th Pſ. and eſpecially in the Song of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which his Lp. ſeems to have forgot.) There is an Alluſion to dramatick writings. But 'tis obſervable that there is ſome difference in the <hi>perſons</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd as anſwering one another, and in the <hi>matter</hi> ſpoken, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd this <hi>alternate</hi> way of ſinging. But I ſee nothing the Bp. has produc'd to make it probable that this way of <hi>alternate</hi> ſinging was the ordinary practice of the Chriſtian Church in the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> He do's indeed alledg thoſe words of the Ap. <hi>Paul</hi> to that purpoſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.31. For ye may all Propheſy one by one,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:134578:12"/> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which (he tells us) <hi>amounts to praiſing God by way of Reſponſes, becauſe propheſying</hi> (he ſaith) includes <hi>Pſalms, Doctrines, Tongues, Revelations</hi> and <hi>Interpretations, p.</hi> 11. But 'tis ſtrange his Lp. ſhou'd examine his criticiſms no better. For if he compare the 26 <hi>v.</hi> of that Chapter with the 6th, he'll eaſily find that <hi>prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying</hi> inſtead of including all thoſe things mention'd <hi>v.</hi> 26. is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht from 'em, <hi>v.</hi> 6th; And if he'll compare this 31 <hi>v.</hi> with thoſe that precede, and thoſe that follow it, he cannot but ſee, that it imports only a direction to the Prophets to ſpeak in their due order without interrupting one another, ſince that God, in whoſe name they ſpake, <hi>was not the Author of confuſion, but of peace, v.</hi> 33. And accordingly ſome judicious Expoſitors underſtand theſe words, <hi>v.</hi> 32. <hi>[The ſpirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets]</hi> of thoſe that were inſpir'd, being capable of refraining to ſpeak even what they had an impulſe for, till they cou'd do it in regular order.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. For <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of <hi>Muſick</hi> there's no Queſtion of their being us'd in the Worſhip of the <hi>Jewiſh Church.</hi> But then it muſt be conſider'd, that 'tis highly probable theſe Inſtruments of Muſick belong'd not to the Worſhip of their Synagogues, but only to the ſervice of their Temple. And there was a particular Inſtitution for 'em, as appears from <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.— 32 <hi>Levit.</hi> 23, 24. And thoſe other Inſtruments of Muſick which <hi>David</hi> appointed, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.4, 5. he is expreſly ſaid to have done it upon the Commandment of the Lord by his Prophets, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.25. And they are on that account call'd God's Muſical Inſtruments, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.22.—and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.6. as having the ſtamp of his Authority. Nor dos the ſingle inſtance of <hi>Miriam</hi>'s Timbrels ſignify any more to prove that the uſe of 'em was no part of the Ceremonial Law, than the uſe of Sacrifices before <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time can prove that they were not. Beſides, <hi>Miriam</hi> being there call'd the Propheteſs, there is juſt reaſon to ſuppoſe that ſhe us'd thoſe Timbrels upon a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular impulſe, as <hi>David</hi> is ſaid to have inſtituted his upon ſuch a particular command from the inſpired Prophets. Since then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental Muſick belong'd to the <hi>Temple-ſervice,</hi> which was but
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:134578:13"/> ceremonial and typical, it muſt be aboliſht with that ſervice; And we can have no warrant to recall it into the Chriſtian Church without as particular an Inſtitution for it, as it had under the Law, any more than we have to uſe other abrogated rites of the <hi>Jewiſh Religion.</hi> Nor needs there any particular command for laying it aſide, when the whole <hi>Temple-ſervice,</hi> of which 'tis a part, is ſo plainly caſhier'd, and it was not, that we can find, us'd in the Worſhip of the <hi>Synagogues,</hi> from which alone we can pretend to draw any ſafe Pattern for Evangelical Worſhip. And 'tis certain that there's no mention of it's being us'd in the Worſhip of the <hi>Christian Church.</hi> And indeed it ſeems more ſutable to divine Worſhip when there was more of external pomp allow'd in it. I confeſs his Lp. would perſuade us the Apoſtles recommend ſuch muſical Inſtruments, becauſe the Ap. <hi>James,</hi> when he exhorts thoſe that were <hi>merry</hi> to <hi>ſing Pſalms,</hi> uſes the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, 5 <hi>James</hi> 13. which he tells us, ſignifies in the Original, ſinging with an <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, p.</hi> 13. But ſure his Lp. can lay no ſtreſs on this Argument, when 'tis ſo apparently weak, and ſo often concludes wrong. Of which I ſhall give him a parallel inſtance of his own. He tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 111. that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (the word generally us'd in the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for Worſhip) ſignifies in the Original, to pay homage by kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the hand. And might he not as wiſely infer from thence, that we are ſtill oblig'd to pay our external homage the ſame way. But if he look again on that paſſage of the Ap. <hi>James,</hi> he will find this ſlender criticiſm too weak a foundation for Organs to ſtand on, becauſe the Apoſtle cou'd not reaſonably ſuppoſe all thoſe to have Inſtruments of Muſick by 'em, or to be capable of uſing 'em, whom he there exhorts to vent their ſpiritual joys, by ſinging of Pſalms. Since then there is no warrant for Inſtrumental Muſick, from ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther precept or example in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> the Bp. is oblig'd by his own principles on that account to turn it out of the Church. And indeed for the Cathedral Muſick, 'tis hard to reconcile it with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.11, 15, 26. For the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> requires that all things be done to Edification, and conſequently that no worſhip be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd up but what is clearly underſtood; ſince if we know not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:134578:13"/> the meaning of the voice of him, that ſpeaks, he is but a Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian to us; Now the generality of the people complain that the Chaunters and Choriſters are juſt ſuch Barbarians to 'em, becauſe their voice is not ſo articulate as to enable 'em to underſtand what they play or ſing.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Having conſider'd the <hi>Directions</hi> of the <hi>Scripture</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to this part of Religious Worſhip, Let us conſider the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> thereof to the Praiſes of God as celebrated in the <hi>Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſht Church,</hi> and in the <hi>Diſsenters Congregations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And before I enter on the <hi>Repreſentation</hi> that his Lp. gives, I ſhall only briefly ſuggeſt, That 'tis evident from the foregoing ſcriptural Account, That the <hi>way</hi> of <hi>praiſing God</hi> among the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,</hi> is exactly ſuited to the <hi>precepts</hi> and <hi>examples</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> relating to this religious duty. For they <hi>praiſe God</hi> both.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By <hi>ſolemn Thanksgivings,</hi> and thoſe ſuited to that glorious Revelation of the Goſpel, and the peculiar Subjects of Praiſe it furniſhes us with, not excluding what the Providence of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Church or towards our ſelves do's ſuggeſt as matter of our grateful acknowledgments.</p>
            <p>And theſe are ſo ſtated a Part of our Worſhip that the <hi>Directory</hi> requires the Miniſter either in his Prayer before, or that after <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> to offer ſuch <hi>Thanksgivings,</hi> and accordingly ſuggeſts theſe Heads of 'em, admirably agreeable to the ſtrain of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He is to give thanks, for the great Love of God in ſending his Son Jeſus Chriſt to us, For the Communication of his H. Spirit, for the light and liberty of the glorious Goſpel, and the rich and heavenly Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings reveal'd therein, as namely Election, Vocation, Adoption, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, Sanctification, and hope of Glory; For the admirable good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God in freeing the Land from Antichriſtian Darkneſs and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rany, and for all other National Deliverances</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and for many tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Bleſſings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. By ſinging of <hi>Pſalms, Hymns</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Songs</hi> in which duty they conſult the Peoples edification by putting ſuch Metre verſions of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> into their hands, as adapt 'em for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:134578:14"/> this uſe of 'em which the Scripture enjoyns. And I am ſure thoſe in uſe among 'em, as the <hi>Scots, Barton's</hi> or <hi>Patrick's</hi> verſions are incomparably better then that obſolete one which is ſtill retain'd in the Pariſh-Churches, tho for what reaſon is hard to imagine, unleſs it be from a ſpleen againſt Reformation, of which ſome think the leaſt ſtep very dangerous.</p>
            <p>One would think then our manner of Praiſing God were unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptionable. But his Lp. it ſeems has very different apprehenſions of this matter, of which he gives us this Summary and very ſtrange Account.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Caſe then between our Church and you in this point, I think impartially ſtands thus. Our Church Praiſes God every Day with 5 or 6 <hi>Pſalms,</hi> beſides other <hi>Hymns</hi> of his own Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and in his own Words and Method, and yet is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted and condemn'd by you in this very point, as teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of men; Whereas you who only Praiſe him in a piece of a Pſalm of a few verſes, and in a method of your own finding out, perſuade your ſelves that you keep the Ordinances of God pure and unmixed from human Invention.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And this his Lp. Recommends to the ſerious conſideration of Diſſenters, as they will herein expect to bear the Tryal of God's Judgment in this matter, p. 24.</p>
            <p>Anſwer: I muſt confeſs my ſelf amaz'd to read theſe words, and am willing rather to impute 'em to his forgetfulneſs and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, then to arraign his judgment or ſincerity. But he is ſo far from having ſum'd up this matter with the <hi>impartiality</hi> he pretends to, that he has been ſo <hi>unfortunate</hi> as ſcarce to have ſaid one true word in his Repreſentation on either ſide. As will appear upon a particular Examination.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Our Church (ſaith he) praiſes God every Day with 5 or 6 Pſalms, beſides other Hymns, of his own Appointment, and in his own words and method.</q>
            </p>
            <p>What do's his Lp. mean? Has God indeed appointed the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> to be the ſtated Forms of Thanksgiving in the Chriſtian
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:134578:14"/> Church, as Thanksgivings are diſtinguiſht, from <hi>Pſalms, Hymns</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Songs,</hi> (as I have ſhewn him they plainly are)? He is ſo far from having prov'd any ſuch thing, that ſince his Lp. has learnt us the way of challenging, I muſt uſe the freedom of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding his Proof of it; For I take it to be a raſh Aſſertion, and of dangerous conſequence. I have ſhewn him already that the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> recommends no other uſe of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> in our publick Praiſes except <hi>ſinging</hi> 'em; Nor indeed are they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly mention'd at all, tho we ſuppoſe 'em intended in 5 <hi>Eph.</hi> and 3. <hi>Col.</hi> But when the Ap. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo often commands us to <hi>to give thanks for all</hi> men, <hi>In all things to give Thanks,</hi> to joyn Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving with all our Prayers, he never recommends the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> as <hi>Forms</hi> of ſuch <hi>Thanksgivings.</hi> And no wonder, For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that we have frequent particular Occaſions of publick Thankſgiving, which there is nothing in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> adapted to, even the <hi>Pſalms</hi> themſelves do not contain the principal matters of Chriſtian <hi>Thanksgivings;</hi> For they make no expreſs mention of the infinite love of God the Father of our Ld. <hi>J. Chriſt</hi> in ſending his own Son, as our great Prophet, to reveal his will to us, and dye for us as our Attoning <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> that he might redeem us by his precious blood; in raiſing him from the dead; exalting him to ſuch glory and dignity as the Head of his Church, and Head over all things to it; and in appointing him the Author of Eternal Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all that believe and obey him. Nor do they ſo clearly mention theſe great and precious promiſes made to us thro this Mediator of a better Covenant, eſpecially thoſe that relate to our adoption, and to the heavenly glory. And yet theſe and the like inſtances of the matchleſs love of God diſcover'd to us in <hi>J. Chriſt</hi> (that glorious mirrour of divine love) are ſo proper matter for our expreſs grateful acknowledgments, that they ſhou'd make up the principal part of our publick Thanksgivings, as they do in all thoſe ſolemn ones recorded for our imitation in the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> And indeed without 'em, this part of Worſhip in a Chriſtian Church wou'd be moſt groſsly defective and unſutable to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel as the laſt and cleareſt Revelation of the will of God. I deny
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:134578:15"/> not but we may in our Chriſtian Thanksgivings, make uſe of the expreſſions of H. <hi>David,</hi> when we celebrate God's works of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, or of his common or ſpecial Providence, becauſe ſo far they contain ſutable matter of Praiſe for a Chriſtian as well as for a Jewiſh Aſſembly. But for celebrating the great work of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ought to be the chief work of our Praiſes on that day, which is now call'd the Ld's day (as being conſecrated to the glory of our Redeemer, as Lord of the New Creation) 'tis evident the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> cannot ſerve us, but we muſt derive the ſubject of thoſe Praiſes entirely from the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> And therefore to ſuppoſe, as the Bp. here dos, that the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> are to be the chief ſtated part of our Chriſtian Praiſes, is no better than to reduce the Chriſtian to the imperfection of the <hi>Jewiſh Church.</hi> And this is ſo plain, that as I obſerv'd before, when the Ap. recommends the ſinging the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> yet he joyns <hi>Hymns</hi> and <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Songs</hi> with 'em, which no doubt were to run in a ſtrain more ſuited to the Evangelical diſpenſation. I confeſs the Bp. has found out a wonderful knack of turning the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> into <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Hymns,</hi> by adding the <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> to 'em, as if that <hi>Doxology</hi> alter'd the matters of <hi>Praiſes</hi> contain'd in 'em.</p>
            <p>So when he ſaith, <hi>Our Church praiſes God with</hi> 5 <hi>or</hi> 6 <hi>Pſalms and other Hymns of his own Appointment,</hi> Why dos he call the <hi>Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>giving</hi> of <hi>Zacharias,</hi> the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and <hi>Simeon, Hymns,</hi> which the Scripture calls not ſo? And why dos he take it for granted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of proving it, that God has appointed what they ſpake on that occaſion for ſtated forms of <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> in all Chriſtian Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, when there is ſo much in 'em ſuited to the particular caſe of thoſe perſons, that tho they are uſeful for our inſtruction, yet they are not calculated for forms of <hi>thanksgivings</hi> to us. If we muſt chooſe forms out of the Scripture, the Apoſtolical ones I produc'd under the head of <hi>Thanksgivings,</hi> will far more exactly ſuit us.</p>
            <p>Again, when he ſays, <hi>Our Church praiſes God with</hi> 5 <hi>or</hi> 6 <hi>Pſalms, &amp;c. in his own words and method.</hi> Why dos he groundleſly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the <hi>words</hi> of the Proſe-tranſlation of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> to be more
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:134578:15"/> the <hi>words of God</hi> than the <hi>words</hi> of a Metre-tranſlation, that do as truly expreſs the ſenſe of the Original? Nay, why dos he pretend that they praiſe God by <hi>Pſalms</hi> in his own method, when they have ſo plainly deviated from his method in the following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the Cathedrals where the <hi>Pſalm</hi> is ſung by the Quire, 'Tis none of God's method that the greater part of the people ſhou'd be excluded from joyning in his Praiſes thro their incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to ſing 'em in Proſe. For (beſides the probable Arguments alledg'd before to prove that the <hi>Pſalms</hi> were compos'd and ſung in metre by the Jews) this is plainly diſagreeable to the Ap's Rule, that all things ſhou'd be done to Edification.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the Pariſh-Churches when the <hi>Pſalms</hi> are only <hi>ſaid,</hi> not <hi>ſung,</hi> they are ſo far from uſing God's method, that their practice has neither Scripture-precept nor pattern, but is one of the Bp's <hi>human Inventions.</hi> Nay, 'tis diſagreeable to the precepts of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> which enjoyn the <hi>ſinging</hi> of Pſalms in our praiſes; and tho his Lp. pretends a diſpenſation for <hi>ſaying</hi> 'em, I have ſhewn him the invalidity of his proofs for it, ſo that we have only his bare word for it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The method of <hi>Reſponſes</hi> in the Pariſh-Churches, as applied by them to all <hi>Pſalms,</hi> even thoſe wherein there is no variety of matter, nor different perſons introduc'd as ſpeaking in 'em, is unſcriptural, and generally ſcarce agreeable to common reaſon, or to the rule of <hi>decency</hi> and <hi>order,</hi> that where the ſenſe is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thro ſeveral verſes, it ſhou'd be interrupted and broken, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toſst between the Miniſter and People, juſt as in the <hi>Litany,</hi> the Miniſter and People make up the Prayer between 'em. So that this is another of the Bp's ſort of <hi>human Inventions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Bp. adds, <hi>Our Church praiſes God with</hi> 5 <hi>&amp;c. and yet is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by you in this very point, as teaching for doctrines the Com-Commandments of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. If he means that ſome weak people may alledge ſuch reaſons for their deſerting the Eſtabliſht Church, becauſe they think theſe unſcriptural practices I have laſt mention'd, ſuch ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:134578:16"/> commands of men as our Saviour ſpeaks of, 7 <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 'Tis indeed poſſible it may be true; for who can be reſponſible for all that injudicious people ſay? But I know none of the <hi>Non-conf.</hi> Writers that have condemn'd 'em as unlawful, or applied that Text to prove 'em ſo. But I muſt tell his Lp, That if any ſhou'd paſs this harſh cenſure on 'em, he is the only perſon I know of, that has furniſht 'em with an Argument <hi>ad Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem,</hi> which I know not how he can Anſwer. For what if they ſhou'd reaſon thus, That way of Worſhip is diſpleaſing to God, which is neither expreſly contain'd in, nor warranted by the Examples of H. Men in Scripture, being one of the commandments of Men condemn'd by our Saviour, 7 <hi>Mark</hi> 7. but the way of Praiſing God with <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Hymns</hi> without ſinging 'em and of uſing Reſponſes in all <hi>Pſalms,</hi> is neither expr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſly contain'd in the H. Scriptures, nor warranted by the Examples of H. Men therein, and yet 'tis the general Practice of all the Pariſh-Churches E—The firſt Propoſition is entirely his own; The ſecond I have <hi>prov'd</hi> in theſe Remarks, and ſhew'd that his Inſtances to the contrary ſignifie nothing to his purpoſe, let himſelf therefore look to the Concluſion.</p>
            <p>And as he has ſo palpably miſrepreſented matters on his own ſide, ſo he has done it much more <hi>foully</hi> on the Diſſenters. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning whoſe practice his words are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas you who only Praiſe him in a piece of a Pſalm of a few ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and in a method of your own finding out, perſuade your ſelves that you keep the ordinances of God pure and unmix'd from human Inv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſwer. I deſire his Lp. when he is pleas'd to examine theſe matters over again to give us ſome reaſon why he ſo confidently tells us, that the <hi>Diſſenters only praiſe God in a piece of a Pſalm.</hi> Do's he not know that publick Thanksgivings without vocal melody, are a Scriptural way of praiſing God, and moſt expreſly enjoyn'd for that end, as a ſtated part of the Worſhip of Chriſtian Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blys, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, 2. and mention'd as their conſtant Practice, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 16? And dos he not know that ſuch ſolemn Thanksgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:134578:16"/> are a ſtated part of the Worſhip of Diſſenters? He cannot pretend Ignorance of this, when he has ſo diligently Read the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory, out of which I have quoted him, the heads of ſuch Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings; and if he compare 'em with the patterns of Apoſtolical Thanksgivings I mention'd before, he'll find they are exactly drawn after their excellent Copy. Nor cou'd he be Ignorant that the Directory enjoyns ſuch Thanksgivings to be conſtantly joyn'd with the Prayer before, or after Sermon, (as the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> alſo directs us to offer 'em up together) unleſs he read it with ſo par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial an eye, as to overlook its excellencys, and only ſpy its defects. And I muſt add, that the practice of <hi>Diſsenters</hi> in this part of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Worſhip to the utmoſt of my obſervation, is very conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this Rule of the Directory. So that his Lp. is oblig'd to do us right, by rectifying this palpable miſtake concerning this part of our Worſhip, and wou'd do well to underſtand our Worſhip better before he undertake to repreſent it with ſo confident pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to impartiality.</p>
            <p>I wou'd here only ſubjoyn, That ſuch ſolemn Thankſgivings as theſe, are undoubtedly of God's appointment. For if he pretend, that they are not offer'd in any words that God has immediately dictated (as he tells us, their Church praiſes him in his own words). I anſwer, That cannot be juſtly imputed to us as a fault, unleſs God had been pleas'd to dictate ſuch Forms of Thankſgiving to us; which if he can ſhew us, he will make the happieſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very that ever man yet did, and ſuch a one as will ſoon end all our Debates about this matter. But I am afraid he muſt bring a new Bible for that purpoſe; for I can find no ſuch in that we have. And indeed if God had provided ſuch Forms of Thankſgiving for the Chriſtian Church, What need were there of any <hi>human Liturgy</hi> for this ordinary part of our Worſhip? What need thoſe few <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects</hi> of <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> (and indeed too few, and too defective) which occur in the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book?</hi> Or how cou'd any on this ſuppoſition excuſe their Arrogance in adding to the Forms God has already preſcrib'd, or annexing thoſe that are of <hi>human Compoſure</hi> to thoſe that are of <hi>divine?</hi> But I hope he'll pretend
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:134578:17"/> no more to produce any ſuch. For as to the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> I have ſhew'd him before that they were never intended for ſuch Forms of <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> to the Chriſtian Church; whoſe <hi>Praiſes,</hi> if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to the matter of 'em, wou'd be extremely defective, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable to the Chriſtian Inſtitution, which ſo far tranſcends the <hi>Moſaical Oeconomy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For what his Lp. ſaith <hi>of the Diſſenters praiſing God only in a piece of a Pſalm of a few verſes, and in a method of their own finding out,</hi> I ſhall only add to what I have already ſuggeſted, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Remarks.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That I think the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſing as much, and uſually much more of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> every Ld's-day, than they do in the <hi>Pariſh-Churches.</hi> In moſt they ſing 'em thrice, in ſome four times. Nor do I know of any obligation laid upon us to ſing a whole Pſalm every time, eſpecially the longer ones, and the ſhorter they often ſing whole.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That tho our method of ſinging 'em in metre require ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of human skill to adapt 'em for that uſe, yet 'tis no more than what thoſe Scriptures warrant, nay plainly oblige us to, that require our ſinging 'em joyntly in publick Aſſemblys, and to do it in a way moſt conducive to Edific<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion.</p>
            <p>His Lp. indeed tells us, <hi>That he takes it for granted, that he A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and primitive Chriſtians prais'd God in proſe, and that metre and rhime are, for ought appears, of human Invention.</hi> But is it not ſtrange that his Lp. ſhou'd confound thoſe two ways of Praiſing God, which the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> ſo clearly diſtinguiſhes? That they prais'd God with <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> in <hi>Proſe,</hi> is unqueſtionable; but that they prais'd God in <hi>proſe Pſalms,</hi> is, as I have ſhewn him, highly improbable. For as in ſome <hi>Pſalms</hi> there is <hi>plain</hi> evidence of <hi>metre,</hi> ſo we have great reaſon, from the teſtimony of <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> to judge the ſame of the reſt. And therefore his conceit that the Spirit of God gave no gifts for compoſing Pſalms in verſe, in oppoſition to the Heathens, who wrote their <hi>Prophecys</hi> and <hi>Hymns</hi> in verſe, is a meer invention of his own: For as there is ſo clear proof that ſome of the Pſalms were inſpir'd in verſe, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:134578:17"/> ſo great probability the reſt were, ſo many judicious Expoſitors do conclude the quite contrary, from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. where <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtry</hi> ſeems to be intended as one of thoſe extraordinary gifts; And 'tis far more probable that the Spirit of God by enjoyning the ſinging of <hi>Pſalms, Hymns,</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Songs,</hi> did intend to reſcue ſo noble a thing as <hi>Poetry</hi> from its wretched abuſe by the <hi>Heathen Prieſts,</hi> that it might be conſecrated to the ſervice of God in his <hi>Temple,</hi> and become an incentive and help to true <hi>Devotion.</hi> So that our way of uſing Pſalms is far more clearly of God's Appointment, becauſe more conformable to his particular directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for ſinging 'em, and to his general Rules of doing it to Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, than theirs wherein they differ from us, as when they are among them only <hi>ſaid</hi> not <hi>ſung,</hi> or <hi>ſung</hi> in <hi>proſe,</hi> not in <hi>metre,</hi> and that only by the leſſer part of the Congregation.</p>
            <p>So what upon the whole, I cannot ſee the leaſt reaſon why the <hi>Diſsenters</hi> ſhou'd in this point be afraid of the Judgment of God, to the Rules of whoſe Goſpel this part of their devotions is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly conform'd; or why they ſhou'd be aſham'd to appeal here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to the judgment of all unprejudic'd men. Nay, I hope they may venture to appeal to his Ep's own judgment, when he is at leiſure to review this matter, and correct his own unhappy miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes about it.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore conclude this Chapter with a few Remarks on ſome paſſages that occur in his 2d and 3d <hi>Section;</hi> As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſee no reaſon why his Lp. ſhou'd think the force, vigour, and loftineſs of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> any more loſt in a <hi>metre</hi> than in <hi>proſe-tranſlation p.</hi> 19th.</p>
            <p>'Tis true indeed, the <hi>metre-tranſlation</hi> of <hi>Hopkins</hi> and <hi>Stern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> is but ill done, ſo is that <hi>proſe-tranſlation</hi> which the <hi>Common Prayer Book</hi> ſtill uſes. And it ſeems an unreaſonable humour to retain both, when there is both a <hi>proſe and metre-tranſlation</hi> far more unexceptionable. The <hi>metre-verſion</hi> commonly call'd the <hi>Scots,</hi> is far better than that us'd in the Pariſh-Churches. <hi>Barton</hi>'s exceeds that, and Mr. <hi>Patrick</hi>'s (if he had not taken too great a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of paraphraſing) excels both; and I doubt not, if a judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:134578:18"/> perſon wou'd undertake the work, 'twere eaſily poſſible to have a <hi>metre-verſion</hi> that wou'd exceed the <hi>proſe</hi> in all theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; And ſuch a one wou'd be of extraordinary uſe to raiſe the devotion of the people in this part of divine Worſhip.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Bp. tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 21. <hi>that we have a command to tranſlate the Pſalms which ſuppoſes into proſe (becauſe the Original is ſo) but none to turn 'em into metre, &amp;c.</hi> Now if, on the contrary, the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> was compos'd in <hi>metre</hi> (as I have ſhew'd to be moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable) then, by his own Argument, the command to tranſlate 'em, ſuppoſes it muſt be done into <hi>metre,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Original</hi> is ſo. And therefore the Bp. has in that and the following page, not only groundleſly ſuppos'd the true ſenſe of <hi>David</hi>'s <hi>Pſalms,</hi> when turn'd into <hi>metre,</hi> to be none of God's word, but has on that account unreaſonably excluded 'em from being any ſubſtantial part of God's Worſhip, and ſpeaks ſlightly of 'em, as if they were intended for little better than a pleaſing diverſion and amuſement. Now if he really believe what he ſaith, I think he ſhou'd in all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon warn the People againſt their preſent Practice. For 'tis certain they do by ſinging 'em in time of publick Worſhip, intend 'em as a ſubſtantial part of it, and will be ſurpriz'd to find this uſe of 'em cenſur'd as an human Invention; whereas if on the contrary the ſinging 'em in Metre be moſt conformable to ſcriptural Precept and Pattern, and bare ſaying 'em diſſonant from both, the Bp. can never excuſe himſelf on his Principles from thus preferring one of his human Inventions to a Divine Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>As to the imperfect way of ſinging the Pſalms by reading every line, 'tis indeed a defect, but ſuch as we muſt be forc'd to conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to, unleſs we cou'd prevail with all our People to get Pſalm Books and learn to Read, or to commit 'em to memory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I wonder why his Lp. ſhou'd charge the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting <hi>Reſponſes,</hi> in publick Worſhip to be <hi>unlawful, p</hi> 23. If he alledg the idle talk of ſome weak people to that purpoſe, is it Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous in him to mention that as the general Opinion of <hi>Diſſenters?</hi> What if we ſhou'd in Retaliation pick up all the weak and fooliſh cenſures of thoſe of his Communion and charge 'em on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:134578:18"/> in general? wou'd he take this well? If not, why dos he forget our <hi>Saviours</hi> Rule, not to do others what he wou'd not they ſhou'd do to him, 6 <hi>Luke</hi> 31. But as it is ſufficient to juſtifie our diſuſe of <hi>Reſponſes</hi> that we have neither <hi>Precept</hi> nor <hi>Example</hi> for their being us'd in a Chriſtian Church, ſo he has the leaſt reaſon to blame any weak <hi>Diſſenters</hi> for cenſuring 'em as unlawful, ſince he has put the moſt dangerous Argument to Prove 'em ſo into their mouths, and if I did not know his Principle to be erroneous, I ſhou'd joyn with 'em in that cenſure.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>Church-Muſick,</hi> I ſhall only add, That what is commonly us'd in the Cathedrals, ſeems at leaſt to be very ſuſpicious, and hardly conſiſtent with the Rules of the Ap. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 11, 15, 26. which I mention'd before; and this ſort of <hi>Muſick</hi> has indeed been ſeverely cenſur'd by many Proteſtant Divines at home and abroad, nay by many Papiſts themſelves, who confeſs it to be unknown in the Church in its pureſt Ages, and but a late invention, which thoſe that trace it the fartheſt, referr no higher than Pope <hi>Vita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s time about the year 690, but others make it of a much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter date; <hi>Aventinus,</hi> and <hi>Anoimus</hi> in their Hiſtories mention <hi>Organs</hi> as a Rarity never ſeen in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Germany</hi> before the 7th. <hi>Century;</hi> Nor were they in general uſe in <hi>Aquiuas</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Aq. Sec. <hi>2</hi>dae Q. <hi>91.</hi> Art. <hi>2.</hi> ad. <hi>4.</hi>
               </note> his time, as <hi>Cajetan</hi> obſerves upon his ſo freely declaring his judgment againſt 'em. Even <hi>Eraſmus</hi> himſelf (who, tho he favour'd the Reformation, yet was cautious and ſlow enough in his advances towards it) cou'd not forbear to complain of this in the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> as an abuſe, which he thought needed to be reform'd, as both unſutable to the gravity and ſolemnity of Chriſtian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and needleſly expenſive, by introducing a crew of charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creatures into the Church, to no good purpoſe, or rather to an ill one. His words on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. are theſe, <q>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:134578:19"/> gannitibus conſumitur. Tantis ſumptibus oneratur Eccleſia ob rem peſtiferam, &amp;c.</hi> We have brought a cumberſome &amp; theatrical Muſick into our Churches, a confus'd noiſe of many voices, ſuch as I think was never heard in the <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Roman Theaters.</hi> For which purpoſe whole Troops of Boys are maintain'd at great charge, whoſe time is waſted in learning this Gabbling. Such expence is the Church burden'd with for a thing that is but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> I wou'd therefore adviſe his Lp. to be more cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of cenſuring their Opinion, <hi>(who make ſuch Muſick in the Worſhip of God unlawful) as againſt nature and Scripture, and on that account a dangerous ſuperſtition and encroachment on Chriſtian liberty.</hi> For as to the Scripture, it has certainly no foundation there in any precept or example that concerns us Chriſtians; and ſure he dos not imagin that the light of Nature dictates ſuch Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick in the Worſhip of God, for then he muſt make it more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary than he himſelf pretends to do. And it looks more like ſuperſtition, according to his own notion of it, to introduce ſuch Muſick into the Church without any ſcriptural ground; And he may be ſure, the <hi>Diſsenters</hi> are not the more fond of it for being one of Pope <hi>Vitalian</hi>'s inventions, and retain'd among us in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the practice of the <hi>Romiſh Church.</hi> I confeſs if any uſe of Organs be allowable, 'tis that in the Pariſh-Church of dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the people into the Tune of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> they ſing, and 'tis on that account chiefly that the Reverend Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> thinks 'em lawful and allowable. But as this very uſe of 'em is certainly deſtitute of any ſcriptural precept or pattern obligatory to us Chriſtians; ſo however others may entertain a more charitable opinion of 'em, yet the Bp, if he will be conſiſtent with himſelf, muſt condemn 'em as a <hi>human Invention,</hi> and (to uſe his Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's phraſe) muſt turn the <hi>Whiſtles</hi> out of the <hi>Kirk.</hi>

            <p>Thus 'tis not reaſonable to underſtand the words of <hi>Joel,</hi> 1 <hi>ch.</hi> 14. 2 <hi>ch.</hi> 17. of any more than the Prophet's ſuggeſting to 'em ſutable matter of Complaint and Supplication; For ſure he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine that the Prophet intended they ſhou'd repeat only thoſe few words when they were to <hi>ſanctify a Faſt, and call a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Aſsembly.</hi> If indeed the Prophet had made mention of a <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> they had already, and had charg'd 'em to add theſe words as a new <hi>Form</hi> to it, Theſe inſtances had been ſomething to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but ſince there's not the leaſt intimation of any ſuch thing, we can no more conclude theſe words to be intended for a ſtated <hi>Form,</hi> than thoſe words form'd into Petitions which Miniſters of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in their Sermons ſuggeſt to the people when they inſtruct 'em in the duty of Prayer; And I might on the ſame grounds ſay, That all the <hi>patterns</hi> of Prayer in the <hi>Directory</hi> are preſcrib'd <hi>Forms.</hi> The ſame may be ſaid as to the paſſage quoted from 14 <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2. On which place Dr. <hi>Comber</hi> (from whom our Author ſeems to have tranſcrib'd the greateſt part of this <hi>Section</hi>) very boldly tells us,<note place="margin">Orig. and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe of Lit. p. 3d.</note> but on no other warrant then his own word, that <hi>God promis'd to heal their backſlidings on their uſing that Form.</hi> It is enough to make us more ſuſpicious of <hi>Forms</hi> when men turn 'em into <hi>Charms</hi> by attributing ſo great Effects to the uſe of 'em. But 'tis ſtrange that his Lp. ſhou'd imagine thoſe words mention'd in that large Prayer of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> 1 Kings 8.47. <hi>(We have ſinned, we have done perverſly, we have committed wickedneſs)</hi> to be a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Confesſion</hi> preſcrib'd to the <hi>Jews,</hi> meerly becauſe the ſame words are repeated, in a very large <hi>Pſalm</hi> mixt of <hi>Confeſsion</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving, viz.</hi> 106 <hi>Pſ.</hi> 6. and in another different <hi>Confeſsion</hi> of <hi>Daniel</hi>'s 9 <hi>ch.</hi> 5? When not only, are theſe very words repeated in both thoſe places with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent additions to 'em, but thoſe 2 larger <hi>Confeſsions</hi> are in quite different words. And the making uſe of theſe words of <hi>Solomon</hi> in each of 'em, is ſo far from proving a preſcrib'd <hi>Form,</hi> that by the ſame Argument he may call all <hi>extempore-prayers Forms,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are ſeveral <hi>Confeſsions</hi> and <hi>Petitions</hi> in 'em put up in ſcriptural Expreſſions. And yet his Lp. lays ſo great ſtreſs on
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:134578:20"/> this Inſtance, as to tell us with admirable confidence, <hi>That it appears from hence that they were not left arbitrarily to choyce and diſcretion, tho other words might be joyn'd with 'em when there was occaſion to enlarge or vary the Form.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. What did not the Pen-man of the 106 <hi>Pſ.</hi> think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf left to his choice, when he enlarges <hi>Solomon's Confeſsion</hi> that makes up but one verſe into a Pſalm that conſiſts of 48 verſe? And did not <hi>Daniel</hi> think himſelf left to his own choice, when tho this large <hi>Confeſsion</hi> in the 106 <hi>Pſ.</hi> was prepar'd to his hands, yet he uſes another of his own quite different from this, becauſe more ſutable to the ſenſe he had of the preſent condition of the <hi>Jewiſh Church?</hi> So that theſe 2 <hi>Confeſsions,</hi> inſtead of being inſtances of Prayer by a <hi>preſcrib'd Form,</hi> are plain inſtances of <hi>occaſional</hi> and <hi>free,</hi> (or, as he calls it, <hi>Extempore)-Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſame may be applied to thoſe words, 106 <hi>Pſ.</hi> 47. quoted from 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.35. For ſure the uſe of a few words recorded in one <hi>Pſalm,</hi> in the compoſure of another, when all the reſt of the <hi>Pſalm</hi> in each is quite different, is but a very lame proof of a preſcrib'd <hi>Form,</hi> and furniſhes us rather with a ſtronger Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the contrary.</p>
            <p>So that the Bp. had better have confin'd himſelf to Dr. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>'s proofs, than add ſo impertinent ones as theſe, which make rather againſt him; And I wonder he omitted that very convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing one for the Antiquity of <hi>Liturgys,</hi> which the foreſaid Dr. draws from the 4 <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. <hi>Then men began to call upon the name of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All then that can be inferr'd from what is granted him, is, <hi>That God did in ſome few caſes preſcribe to the Jews a Form of words, and when he did ſo, they were oblig'd to uſe it. So that this mode of Praying by a ſett Form of words, is not in general unlawful.</hi> And if this Conceſſion will do his Lp. any ſervice, he is welcome to it.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>I ſee not the leaſt Evidence in the Old Teſtament of a ſtinted
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:134578:21"/> Liturgy preſcrib'd by God to the Jewiſh Church, even as to their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary publick Prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if ſuch a <hi>Liturgy</hi> be that which the Bp. intends to aſſert when he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 25. <hi>That the Scriptures direct us to offer up our Prayers in a ſett and prepared Form of words,</hi> I muſt deſire his Lp. to bring us better proof of it, than what he has alledg'd from <hi>p.</hi> 25. to <hi>p.</hi> 29. and I have here examin'd. To which he adds what I wou'd now farther conſider, <q>That the whole Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> is a collection of Prayers of all ſorts. And there are few of 'em, but what are moſt excellent Forms of Prayer, expreſs'd in ſuch pathetick, ſignificant and moving words, that we have great reaſon to thank God for furniſhing us with 'em, and which we can never hope to equal by any of our own inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuch as are the 4, 5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> On this Account they were us'd by the <hi>Jews</hi> as the conſtant ſervice and <hi>Liturgy</hi> perform'd in their <hi>Temple,</hi> as we may gather from what I formerly quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. Why he ſhou'd call the whole Book of <hi>Pſalms</hi> a colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Prayers</hi> of all ſorts, when the far greateſt part of 'em are undoubtedly <hi>Prayſes,</hi> as diſtinguiſht from <hi>Prayers,</hi> I know not. That ſome <hi>Pſalms</hi> conſiſt much of Petitions, and conſequently may be call'd <hi>Prayers,</hi> I doubt not. But then he ſhou'd have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd that theſe <hi>Prayers</hi> are compos'd in the ſtrain of <hi>Songs,</hi> and moſt probably in <hi>metre,</hi> and were deſign'd to be <hi>ſung,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears concerning thoſe he mentions, <hi>viz.</hi> the 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th' 9th, 10th, 12th; all of which (except the 10th that has no Title) are directed to the <hi>chief Muſitian,</hi> or expreſly aſſerted to be <hi>ſung.</hi> Now 'tis certain ſuch <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> as are intended to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly <hi>ſung,</hi> muſt be <hi>ſett forms;</hi> But there is no neceſſity that other ordinary <hi>Prayers</hi> ſhou'd be ſuch <hi>ſett forms</hi> that were never compos'd in that manner, nor deſign'd for that uſe.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:134578:21"/> of, and about which we are now only concern'd to enquire. For that Text ſpeaks not one word of <hi>Prayers</hi> at all, but only of <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and if it had mention'd or included <hi>Prayers,</hi> it cou'd refer to no other <hi>Prayers</hi> but ſuch as were <hi>ſung,</hi> which we all agree muſt be <hi>ſett forms.</hi> And theſe <hi>Pſalm prayers</hi> the Bp. knows the <hi>D ſſenters</hi> he oppoſes never ſcrupl'd. For they are uſeful to be <hi>ſung for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction</hi> by thoſe, who cannot offer 'em up as properly a <hi>prayer,</hi> becauſe their condition and circumſtances are no way like the Pſalmiſt's, when he compos'd 'em. But the Queſtion is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>prayers</hi> in the proper ſenſe, ſuch as are not <hi>ſongs,</hi> but compos'd in proſe, and in the ſame ſtyle as our other ordinary requeſts are; for ſuch are the prayers of the <hi>Engliſh Liturgy,</hi> and 'tis for ſuch a <hi>Liturgy</hi> the Bp. is oblig'd to produce us ſome <hi>precept</hi> or <hi>pattern</hi> in the H. Scriptures And theſe Inſtances of <hi>pſalm-prayers</hi> ſignify no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this purpoſe. Nor indeed do we among all the inſtances of publick <hi>prayers</hi> recorded after the time of the Pſalms being penn'd find one of theſe <hi>pſalm-prayers</hi> us'd; But on the contrary, thoſe that do occur are plainly <hi>free</hi> and <hi>conceived prayers,</hi> ſuch as the preſent occaſions of preſenting 'em did draw from the devout minds of the pious ſupplicants. Of which I ſhall give ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances under the next head. I ſhall only add, That if the <hi>Biſhop</hi> think theſe <hi>pſalm prayers</hi> of <hi>H. David</hi> better for our uſe than any of human compoſu e, why dos he not lay aſide all the <hi>Collects</hi> of the <hi>Common prayer-book</hi> that are certainly of <hi>human Invention,</hi> and confine himſelf to the <hi>Pſalter</hi> as his only <hi>Liturgy</hi> for <hi>prayer</hi> as well as <hi>praiſe?</hi> What can excuſe his uſing worſe, when he has better? Or rather why ſhou'd he imagin 'em intended for <hi>forms</hi> of <hi>proſe-prayer</hi> to us at all, any farther than <hi>David</hi>'s devout expreſſions may be us'd ſo far as they ſuit our caſe, when the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> ſo largely inſtructs us to offer our <hi>prayers</hi> in ſo different a manner from that practis'd in the <hi>Old,</hi> particularly with a more expreſs reference to <hi>J.

            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Publick Prayers</hi> there are no leſs clear Inſtances of ſuch as were <hi>conceived</hi> or <hi>free,</hi> even after the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> were penn'd, which the <hi>Bp.</hi> imagines to have been the Jewiſh <hi>Liturgy.</hi> Such was that Excellent Prayer of <hi>Solomon's</hi> upon the Dedication of the Temple, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.22. Such was that of <hi>Aſa</hi> when that vaſt <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opian</hi> Hoſt came againſt him, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11. ſuch was that of <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> on a like occaſion, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That of <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in reference to <hi>Rabſhekah's</hi> blaſphemous Threats was an Inſtance of either private or publick free Prayer, 36 <hi>Iſ.</hi> 15, 16. Of the ſame kind was <hi>Ezra's,</hi> 9 <hi>Ezra.</hi> 5, 6, 7. The Confeſſion in <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 9 <hi>ch.</hi> 5, 6, 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not taken from any precedent <hi>Form,</hi> but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:134578:22"/> wholly new. And yet 'tis evident that in moſt of theſe caſes thoſe Holy Men might have made up <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> for thoſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of H. <hi>Davids'</hi> words in ſome of the <hi>Pſalm prayers,</hi> but they choſe rather to offer up ſuch Prayers as the ſerious ſenſe of their preſent caſe did ſuggeſt to 'em, and that made 'em ready ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants to God for Relief, without the need of ſeeking out a preſcrib'd <hi>Form</hi> for their purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Now as the Bp. may ſafely infer from God's having recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Form</hi> of words in Prayer in reference to ſome caſes, that <hi>prayer</hi> by a ſet <hi>Form</hi> is not in it ſelf <hi>unlawful,</hi> ſo I may much more infer from theſe more numerous Inſtances of <hi>free prayers,</hi> That our <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> according to the Examples of theſe H. Men, ſhou'd be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to our ſeveral particular occaſions and neceſſities, and therefore 'tis ſo far from being <hi>unlawfull,</hi> to uſe <hi>conceived or free prayers</hi> without any preſcribed <hi>Form,</hi> that to tye up our ſelves to ſuch ſett and preſcribed <hi>Forms</hi> will not ordinarily anſwer the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Calls which we have in the Providence of God to this holy Duty, by ſuch various Emergency's as no ſett <hi>Forms</hi> can Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſuit.</p>
            <p>Nay whereas the <hi>Bp.</hi> can infer no more from his Inſtances then that when God preſcribes us a <hi>Form</hi> we ſhou'd uſe it, and he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves our doing ſo, we may from theſe Examples laſt produc'd with equal reaſon infer, that we may uſe <hi>free prayer</hi> in thoſe occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in which God has not preſcribed us any ſuch <hi>Forms;</hi> and that he do's approve this way of addreſſing our ſelves to him, with ſuch Prayers as the feeling of our own neceſſities and conſideration of our particular caſe dos prompt us to offer.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, That if there be no Evidence of ſuch a ſtinted <hi>Liturgy</hi> in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> we can much leſs expect any proof of one in the <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> becauſe ſuch a <hi>Liturgy</hi> if neceſſary at all, was much more ſo under the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> when there was not ſuch an abundant Effuſion of the H. Spirit in his Graces and Gifts as now under the <hi>New.</hi> Nay if the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church had no ſtinted <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> preſcribed by God, much leſs had any uninſpired men any power given 'em to preſcribe one, and confine all publick Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations

               <p n="1">I. I ſhall conſider thoſe 2 things the Bp. inſiſts on in favour of Praying by preſcrib'd <hi>Forms,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>I think it</hi> (ſays he) <hi>certain that our Saviour and his Apoſtles prayed by a Form, for they joyn'd in the Worſhip of the Temple and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, which conſiſted in Pſalms, as I have already ſhew'd, and in ſome certain Forms of Prayers added to 'em, and conſtantly us'd in their daily ſervice, as we learn from thoſe that give an Account of the Jewiſh Worſhip at that time. Now our Saviour and his Apoſtles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frequently pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Anſw. That our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> pray'd by a <hi>Form</hi> when they us'd the <hi>pſalm prayers,</hi> there is no doubt, and ſo do all thoſe that ſing 'em. That there was a ſtinted <hi>Liturgy</hi> beſides, or a collection of <hi>Forms</hi> of proſe-prayer to which the publick Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations were confin'd to the excluſion of occaſional free Prayer, the Bp. has no where prov'd; and the contrary is far more probable from many inſtances of ſuch free-prayer in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> which I have before alledg'd. Nay, ſhou'd we, to oblige his Lp, grant him, that ſome <hi>forms</hi> of <hi>proſe-prayer</hi> were ordinarily us'd in the Jewiſh Worſhip (tho we muſt do it on the uncertain credit of <hi>Rabbinical</hi> Writers, whoſe teſtimony is of little value, and not on the teſtimony of the H. Scripture) yet I ſee not how the Bp. can make any more of this, than that our Saviour thought it not unlawful to joyn in ſuch publick <hi>forms</hi> of <hi>proſe-prayer,</hi> but it will by no means follow, that he preferr'd ſuch pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:134578:23"/> 
                  <hi>forms</hi> before <hi>free-prayers,</hi> and deſign'd by his practice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the <hi>former</hi> to the Chriſtian Church to the excluſion of the <hi>latter.</hi> (For as I ſhall ſhew him anon, there are ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions to the contrary) And yet unleſs his Lp. cou'd draw this Inference from our <hi>Saviour's</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> practice, I ſee little ſervice it can do him. Nay I fear, if the Argument from our <hi>Saviour's</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> practice herein be urg'd ſo far, it will prove much more than thoſe intend who uſe it. For it will prove that we ought in imitation of their example, to retain and adhere to that <hi>Liturgy</hi> which theſe Gentlemen pretend the <hi>Jews</hi> had, (and which they tell us they can yet produce the particular parts of), to whoſe forms of Prayer Dr. <hi>Comber</hi> tells us, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> added his, and was herein <hi>ſo afraid of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as to take every ſentence out of the jewiſh Forms then in uſe</hi>

And why ſhou'd they impoſe ſo <hi>many forms</hi> on others, when our great Maſter impos'd but <hi>one,</hi> and ſuch a one as he borrow'd the very ſentences of from the Forms then publickly us'd. So that theſe Gentlemen ſhou'd, if they will be conſiſtent with themſelves, plead for laying aſide our <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and uſing that old one which Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> has ſo happily retriev'd for us out of the Jewiſh <hi>Rabbins.</hi> I wou'd therefore adviſe 'em to uſe this Argument from the practice of the Jewiſh Church in our Saviour's time (about which we are at the beſt but very uncertain) with great tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and caution, leaſt they overdo with it, and leaſt the <hi>jewiſh Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy inſtead</hi> of <hi>under propping</hi> the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book, undermine and throw it down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 31. <hi>That our Saviour has put this matter out of all diſpute with impartial men, by preſcribing a Form to his Diſciples, when they deſired him to teach them to pray as</hi> John <hi>did his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.

His Lp. has a very happy faculty of arguing matters of Diſpute before he ſtate 'em, For indeed the ſtating 'em might chance to ſpoyl all the force of his Arguments; and therefore he generally thinks it more adviſeable to let that alone. He tells us, <hi>Our Saviour has put this matter out of all Diſpute with impartial Men by preſcribing a Form to his Diſciples.</hi> What matter of Diſpute dos his Lp. mean? Is it whether a <hi>form</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> be lawfull? Or is it, whether our Saviour has preſcrib'd a ſtinted <hi>Liturgy</hi> to the Chriſtian Church in their publick Adminiſtrations, or whether he has commiſſion'd Ordinary Paſtors to preſcribe and impoſe ſuch a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and confine others to the uſe of it? Or whether he in general enjoyns us to pray only by a <hi>Form,</hi> or not ordinarily with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out one? If he mean the firſt, <hi>(whether a Form of Prayer be lawfull?)</hi> That's no matter of Diſpute at all, between the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> and the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church,</hi> for as I ſhall ſhew him anon, there is never a Meeting in which they do not uſe one, and there are many in which this particular <hi>form</hi> of <hi>prayer</hi> is conſtantly us'd. So that if this be all he wou'd prove he may ſpare his labour, tho perhaps his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for this are not altogether ſo convincing and ſolid as he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines. If the Queſtion be, <hi>(whether our Saviour has preſcrib'd a ſtinted Liturgy to the Chriſtian Church?)</hi> as one wou'd think it ſhou'd, What ſignifies his preſcribing this <hi>ſingle form,</hi> to the proof of it, unleſs the Bp thinks our <hi>Liturgy</hi> ſhou'd conſiſt only of that <hi>one prayer,</hi> or cou'd produce more <hi>forms</hi> preſcrib'd by our Saviour to make up a <hi>Liturgy;</hi> And if he cou'd do that, what will become of the <hi>Service-Book,</hi> What have we to do with that <hi>human Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> when we have a <hi>Liturgy</hi> appointed and compos'd by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour himſelf? If the Queſt. be, <hi>(Whether our Saviour has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:134578:24"/> the ordinary Paſtors of the Church to preſcribe and impoſe publick Forms?)</hi> what dos all he here alledges about this <hi>ſingle form</hi> preſcrib'd by Chriſt, ſignifie to prove any ſuch thing, when he can produce no ſuch commiſſion, nor the leaſt ſhadow of it in all the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> nay when the Rules of it about Prayer ſeem rather inconſiſtent with any ſuch Commiſſion (as I ſhall ſhew him anon)? If the Queſt. be, <hi>(Whether our Saviour in general enjoyns us to pray only by a form, or not ordinarily without one?)</hi> what dos any thing his Lp. has alledg'd ſignifie to the right determination of this Queſtion? If he deſign to prove that Chriſt by preſcribing this <hi>form,</hi> has enjoynd in general our Praying only by a <hi>ſett form</hi> and never otherwiſe, (as one wou'd think his following words wou'd import, when he tells us, <q>That our Saviour's teaching 'em was not by directing 'em to wait for the impulſes of the Spirit, and immediate Inſpiration from God of what they were to offer up to him; We do not find him ſaying, when ye pray, ſpeak what ſhall come into your minds, or what ſhall be given you in that hour without taking thought about what they were to ſay), he knows well enough his Argument is no way conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive;</q> For he himſelf owns that God <hi>has not forbidden all extempore prayers,</hi> nay owns <hi>that ſome occaſions require the uſe of 'em in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> and <hi>that in ſuch caſes a man may depend on the aſsiſtance of God's Spirit when he has not-time to reduce his deſires into form before he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers 'em, p.</hi> 54, 55. He cannot therefore, without contradicting himſelf, pretend that our Saviour, by preſcribing this <hi>form,</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to exclude all <hi>extempore</hi> or <hi>free prayer.</hi> Nor is there any force in the Argument to prove that our Saviour intended to oblige us ordinarily to pray by a <hi>form,</hi> becauſe he once preſcrib'd <hi>one</hi> as a comprehenſive ſummary of our deſires. For his general Rules (as I ſhall obſerve anon) do far more directly favour and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance <hi>free prayer,</hi> than this one inſtance dos the uſe of <hi>forms,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of <hi>forms</hi> impos'd by others, about which the main diſpute lyes. And what he has here offer'd to confirm it, ſignifies nothing to the purpoſe; or if it did, wou'd prove too much. For our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour may teach men the way of free prayer, without <hi>directing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:134578:25"/>
'em to wait for the Impulſcs of the Spirit and immediate Inſpiration from God,</hi> ſince none pretend to ſuch impulſes and immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration as neceſſary in order to it. He himſelf owns, that in caſes of neceſſity we may depend on the <hi>aſsiſtance of the Spirit</hi> to pray <hi>extempore,</hi> and yet he dos not, I hope, mean we may expect ſuch <hi>immediate inſpiration.</hi> Nay, our Saviour may adviſe us to <hi>free prayer</hi> without telling us, <hi>We muſt ſpeak what comes into our minds, or ſhall be given us in that hour, without taking thought what we are to ſay,</hi> For <hi>free prayer</hi> is ſo far from excluding ſerious premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that no man ſhou'd uſe it, eſpecially in publick, without it, unleſs in caſes of abſolute neceſſity. Nay, if this reaſon ſignify'd any thing, it wou'd prove too much, that we are never to pray <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore</hi> at all, becauſe we have no ground even in caſes of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to expect ſuch <hi>immediate Inſpiration.</hi> And here I wou'd once for all, caution his Lp. againſt that common miſtake he ſeems to run into, as if we imagin'd the aſsiſtance of the H. Spirit in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to lye in immediately dictating our words to us, Whereas we no more expect that in <hi>Prayer</hi> than in <hi>Preaching.</hi> For we ſuppoſe this Gift of Prayer to be a common gift. And tho we have known many private Chriſtians, whoſe natural parts in all other things are but weak and low, endued by the Spirit of God with a conſiderable meaſure of this Gift, as the fruit and reward of their diligence in this duty, Yet we doubt not that many natural En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, as readineſs of apprehenſion, copiouſneſs of fancy, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of affection, fluency of expreſsion may contribute much to diſpoſe a man for greater eminency in it; Nor do we think the aſsiſtance of the H. Spirit in this duty alters that ſtyle or way of expreſsion that nature or cuſtom has habituated men to. So that the H. Spirit is no more accountable for the indecent expreſsions of good men in <hi>Prayer</hi> than in <hi>Preaching,</hi> tho we may expect his help both in our endeavours to <hi>acquire</hi> abilities and gifts for theſe duties, and in the <hi>exerciſe</hi> of 'em.</p>
               <p>But before I diſmiſs what he hath ſaid in reference to this Prayer of our Lord, I ſhall ſubjoyn the following Remarks thereon.</p>

               </p>
               <p>To this purpoſe they obſerve that the three firſt Petitions <hi>[Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed be thy Name, Thy Kingdom come, Thy Will be done, &amp;c.]</hi> ſeem to be chiefly calculated, both to the doctrine which <hi>Christ</hi> as well as <hi>John</hi> deliver'd concerning the <hi>Kingdom of God being at hand,</hi> and to the expectation the pious Jews then generally entertain'd of the <hi>Meſsiah's Kingdom</hi> being publickly ſet up in the world; They obſerve farther, that in the Petition for <hi>forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> There is not the leaſt mention made of the <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> the <hi>death,</hi> or <hi>blood</hi> of Chriſt, in vertue whereof we muſt now ſue for pardon; whereas our Saviour after his Reſurrection and Aſcention is every where propos'd, as our High-Prieſt, Mediator, Interceſſor and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, of which there is no notice taken in this Form. And hence they ſuppoſe that 'tis on this account that our Lord long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the delivery of this Form tells his Diſciples, 16 <hi>Joh.</hi> 24. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto have ye asked nothing in my Name,</hi> and therefore he requires 'em <hi>now to ask the Father in his Name,</hi> and aſſures 'em he will <hi>grant their Petitions.</hi> And accordingly they obſerve that the <hi>Doxolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys</hi> mention'd in Scripture after our Saviour's Aſcenſion, lead us di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and expreſly to aſcribe our Praiſes to God <hi>by Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>in his Name,</hi> of which there is not the leaſt hint in that us'd in the <hi>Ld's-Prayer.</hi> Whence they conclude it to be chiefly ſuited to the ſtate of the Diſciples of Chriſt, while under his perſonal Miniſtry on Earth, in which the principal myſteries of the Goſpel that depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on his Death, Reſurrection and Aſcenſion were not yet ſo

               <p n="3">3. The compilers of the <hi>Directory</hi> ſeem to give the moſt fair and juſt Account of the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> viz. That it was chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd as a <hi>perfect Pattern,</hi> but may alſo be conveniently us'd as a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That 'tis a <hi>perfect Pattern</hi> his Lp-will not deny, and the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable method and order as well as the comprehenſiveneſs of it's Petitions ſhew it be ſo as to the matter of Prayer. And the words of our Lord ſeem to recommend it alſo as a fit Compendium and Summary of our Deſires. Tho that it was ſo ſtrictly intended for a <hi>Form</hi> as that all alteration of the words in it ſhou'd be ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as the Bp. ſuggeſts, I do not ſee. And 'tis ſtrange he ſhou'd
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:134578:26"/> no better ward off the common objection againſt this conceit, <hi>viz. That the words of the Prayer are not the ſame in the</hi> 2 <hi>Evangeliſts.</hi> For tho we ſhou'd allow him that <hi>treſpaſſes</hi> and <hi>debts</hi> are the ſame in the <hi>Syriack,</hi> yet ſure he cannot be ignorant that not only are the words different in the 4th. <hi>Petition,</hi> but what is more material, the <hi>Doxology</hi> is left out in the Evangeliſt <hi>Luke,</hi> where our Saviour's words ſeem more expreſs for the uſe of this <hi>Prayer.</hi> Nay 'tis pleaſant that his Lp. ſhou'd, to aggravate the danger of altering the words, compare it to the danger of <hi>altering thoſe of our Creed, p.</hi> 35. As if he did not know, that the words of it have been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently alter'd, that no writer in the 3 firſt <hi>Centuries</hi> has the <hi>Creed</hi> (call'd the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi>) in the ſame words that we have now, and that the Forms we meet with in <hi>Ignatius, Irenaeus, Tertullian, Origen, Cyprian,</hi> and <hi>Gregory Neocaeſar</hi> are all in different words, nay in ſome Forms ſeveral Articles are inſerted that are not in others, Nay in the <hi>Creed</hi> as we have it, no doubt the Article of <hi>Chriſt's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending into Hell</hi> ſhou'd be alter'd as to the words of it, becauſe we do not commonly take <hi>Hell</hi> for the inviſible ſtate which <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> was deſign'd to expreſs. I confeſs 'tis ſomething more formidable when he compares the danger of altering the words in the <hi>Lord's-Prayer</hi> to that of <hi>changing the word given by the General in a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, p.</hi> 35. Tho where the wit or ſenſe of the compariſon lies, I cannot imagine, unleſs his Lp. thinks the bare words of that Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be as frightful to the Infernal Fiends as ſome crafty Prieſts have pretended the Name or Pſalter of the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> is, but apprehends thoſe our ſpiritual enemies will reſume their courage if we make the leaſt change in 'em.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only add here, That his Lp. has not produc'd any other inſtance of a preſcrib'd Form of Prayer in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this; He dos indeed, <hi>p.</hi> 50. tell us, <hi>That Chriſt in his Agony repeated a verſe of the</hi> 22d <hi>Pſalm, and as ſome believe</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the whole Pſalm, by which Act he recommends to us Forms of Prayer with his dying breath, as the moſt proper means of expreſsing our condition to God, and as moſt ſutable to the divine Majeſty.</hi> To which I ſhall only return this brief Anſwer, That his Lp. wou'd have done
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:134578:27"/> well, <hi>firſt</hi> to have told us, what grounds any have to believe that our Saviour repeated the whole Pſalm, and <hi>if he did not,</hi> how the repeating one verſe of it ſo applicable to his preſent caſe, ſhou'd be a proof of his uſing a <hi>form</hi> of Prayer at all, and much more how it ſhou'd prove his <hi>recommending ſuch forms to us with his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breath, &amp;c.</hi> As if a man might not in a <hi>free prayer,</hi> chooſe out and apply ſome ſcriptural expreſsions to his own caſe. Indeed the words he quotes are not properly a <hi>Prayer</hi> at all, and if they were, look altogether as like an inſtance of <hi>occaſional free-prayer,</hi> ſo that if I wou'd argue at this looſe rate, I might with as good reaſon pretend that our Lord recommended <hi>extempore-prayers with his dying breath, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>The Bp. has not produc'd the leaſt evidence of Chriſt's enjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or recommending to Chriſtian Churches the uſe of ſtinted Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys even as to the ordinary publick Prayers which they are to offer up.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that tho the ſame matters of Prayer conſtantly occur in that duty when publickly offer'd eſpecially in the celebration of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm</hi> and the <hi>Ld's-Supper,</hi> yet neither dos our <hi>Saviour</hi> nor his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> preſcribe any ſtated <hi>forms</hi> for 'em. Whereas if our Lord had judg'd 'em ſo neceſſary, or ſo highly uſeful as ſome pretend, Nothing cou'd have been more conducive to have fixt the uſe of 'em, and prevented all corruptions in 'em, as well as ſcruple a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 'em, than to have furniſht the Church with a Divinely inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Liturgy. Nay, what is more conſiderable, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> content themſelves with giving us general commands to <hi>pray,</hi> and with <hi>all prayer</hi> and <hi>ſuppli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Dos not this plainly imply that they took not ſuch an <hi>impoſed Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> to be neceſſary to the Churches Edification and Peace? but rather ſuppos'd that the ordinary occaſions of publick Prayer were too various and different to be confin'd to ſuch ſett and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:134578:27"/> 
                  <hi>forms?</hi> If it be pretended, there was no need of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing ſuch <hi>Forms</hi> when the <hi>Jewiſh Liturgy</hi> was ſtill extant and us'd, I anſwer, That (not to repeat what has been objected againſt the pretenſions of a ſtinted <hi>Liturgy</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi>). I hope none can imagin that a <hi>Jewiſh Liturgy</hi> cou'd be ſutable to the Chriſtian <hi>Oeconomy</hi> after our Saviour's Aſcenſion, in the Chriſtian Churches that were planted by the Apoſtles. So that if a <hi>Liturgy</hi> in general were neceſſary to the Chriſtian Church, there was the greater reaſon why they ſhou'd have ſubſtituted <hi>one</hi> in the room of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> in the <hi>Churches</hi> they ſettl'd; Since then they no way ſo much as recommend ſuch a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> but left even ordinary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors to the free exerciſe of their own abilities, in Prayer as well as in other parts of their publick miniſtrations, We may with great probability infer that they judg'd it more conducive to Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the Paſtors of Churches ſhou'd uſe thoſe ordinary gifts wherewith they were furniſht for the performance of this duty without being ty'd up to any <hi>ſett-forms;</hi> And accordingly thoſe that have been moſt anxiouſly concern'd to find out <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Liturgys</hi> in the 3 firſt and pureſt Ages of Chriſtianity, have but loſt their labour, and have but trifled with us in their moſt confident pretences to diſcover ſuch <hi>Liturgys.</hi> As appears by Mr. <hi>Clerkſon's Diſcourſe of Liturgys,</hi> and Mr. <hi>S B's Examination</hi> of Dr. <hi>Comber's Anſwer in his Scholaſtical Hiſtory of the uſe of Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>'Tis evident, That the general Rules of Scripture cannot be duly obſerv'd by thoſe that pray no otherwiſe than by a ſett Form of Words.</hi>

               <p>They command us to pray with <hi>all Prayer and Supplication, and for all men, In every thing to make known our Requeſt to God,</hi> 6 <hi>Eph.</hi> 18. — 4 <hi>Col.</hi> 6.— 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now 'tis evident there is a vaſt <hi>variety</hi> of occaſions and emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencys in which we ſhou'd apply our ſelves to God by Prayer, which it cannot be expected any preſcribed <hi>Forms</hi> ſhou'd exactly ſuit. This is moſt obvious in our <hi>Cloſet-prayers.</hi> There is ſcarce any one day in which we have not ſome occaſion to vary
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:134578:28"/> our Requeſts. There are ſome particular failings we have occaſion particularly to confeſs, renounce, and implore divine Aid againſt; Or there are ſome particular dutys which we need to beg direction and aſſiſtance for the diſcharge of. So that our own meditation eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day muſt ſuggeſt to us the moſt proper matter of our addreſſes to God, and many requeſts ſutable to our particular caſe muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, if we confine our devotions to the <hi>ſett forms</hi> of others. So that ſuch as are at preſent forc'd thro their Ignorance, and inability to confine themſelves to ſuch <hi>Forms,</hi> are like <hi>lame</hi> People that cannot go without the help of <hi>Crutches;</hi> And for ſuch ſo to ſit down and ſatisfie themſelves with their Book-prayer and preſcrib'd <hi>Forms,</hi> as to go no farther, wou'd be (to uſe the ſignificant expreſſions of the excellent Biſhop <hi>Wilkins) as if a Man who had once need of crutches ſhou'd always afterwards make uſe of 'em, and ſo necesſitate himſelf to a continual Impotency.</hi> Nay the Bp. himſelf cou'd not but own that the uſe of <hi>conceiv'd prayers</hi> is founded on that general Rule of Scripture, which <hi>Commands us to ask of God what we lack,</hi> p 56. But then he groundleſly adds the following words which 'tis moſt proper I ſhou'd conſider in this place. viz. <q>of this Rule our own Prudence makes the Application in ſuch extemporary occaſions, but when we ſet up this human Application of this general Rule in oppoſition to that particular manner of asking Commanded by God, and Practis'd by H. Men, which is by ſett and premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Forms, in the ordinary Worſhip of God, and turn God's way out of his worſhip to make room for one of our own, This is to diſplace a particular Command of God on pretence of guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves by a general one; In which we are not only more liable to miſtakes, but we fail of paying due reſpect to God's directions. For general Commands only take place in ſuch Caſes where God has not laid down a Particular Rule.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. His Lp. here very Prudently takes for granted what he has no where Prov'd, that God has given a particular Command to the Chriſtian Church to Pray in all ordinary caſes by ſett and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated <hi>Forms.</hi> But has he brought any other Proof of this
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:134578:28"/> then that Chriſt once Recommended one comprehenſive <hi>Pattern</hi> or <hi>Form?</hi> And dos he think this amounts to a Command that we ſhou'd in all ordinary caſes uſe <hi>Forms,</hi> when there is not one tittle to that purpoſe in the H. Scriptures and Particularly in the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> when there are no ſuch <hi>Forms</hi> given us by God, nor the leaſt <hi>Direction</hi> who ſhou'd compoſe 'em for us? If we ſhou'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him that the <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> is preſcrib'd as a <hi>Form</hi> that muſt be conſtantly us'd in Private and Publick Worſhip (which he neither has, nor indeed can any man Prove) yet all that he cou'd infer thence, were, That we have a particular Command to uſe that <hi>Form;</hi> but it will by no means follow, that we have any ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Command to uſe other <hi>human preſcribed Forms in all our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Prayers.</hi> So that to uſe <hi>free prayer</hi> in our ordinary Publick Worſhip dos not <hi>diſplace any particular command, nor turn God's way out of his Worſhip to make room for our own.</hi> For God has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly by this general precept oblig'd us to <hi>free-prayer,</hi> and has no way confin'd the uſe of it to extraordinary caſes only, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no way recommended any <hi>ſett form</hi> to Chriſtians, unleſs we take this comprehenſive <hi>patern</hi> of Chriſt's to be <hi>One,</hi> and if we do, that's the <hi>only one</hi> he has enjoyn'd. So that I may more juſtly hence infer, That thoſe <hi>turn God's way out of his Worſhip,</hi> who confine men in their publick Adminiſtrations to ſuch <hi>human ſett-forms</hi> as God has no where enjoyn'd the uſe of, by either <hi>general</hi> or <hi>particular</hi> precept, and are indeed in the Bp's ſenſe only <hi>human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions;</hi> whereas thoſe more exactly obſerve his <hi>directions,</hi> who uſe the only <hi>form</hi> which there is any appearance of his having preſcrib'd to us Chriſtians, but as to all other Prayers, uſe the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which God allows us when he enjoyns no other <hi>Forms</hi> but this.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>It ſeems highly agreeable to the Wiſdom of God, that the mode of praying with or without a form ſhou'd be left ſo far undetermin'd as to confine us to neither way by any particular precept.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore he has only given us general rules relating to this duty, and one comprehenſive either <hi>Pattern</hi> or <hi>Form,</hi> but has left us in the particular exerciſes of this duty to the determination of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:134578:29"/> Chriſtian Prudence, whether we ſhall uſe a <hi>ſett-form</hi> or not. For there is no doubt, but that the ignorance and weakneſs of ſome may need ſuch <hi>crutches,</hi> as <hi>ſett-forms,</hi> eſpecially when they pray with others; and therefore ſuch helps are allow'd 'em. And yet more grown and improv'd Chriſtians ſhou'd by their advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in divine knowledge, by their frequent conſideration of their own neceſſities, and by frequent exerciſe in this duty, endeavour to attain thoſe Gifts that may ſett 'em above the need of thoſe helps, and enable 'em to expreſs their own ſentiments and deſires in Prayer to God on all emergent occaſions, without running to other mens <hi>books</hi> and <hi>compoſures</hi> for that end. Eſpecially Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhou'd be furniſht with ſuch a Gift. And therefore God has not thought fit to hinder the exerciſe of, and improvement in ſuch an excellent Gift, by preſcribing to either <hi>People</hi> or <hi>Miniſters</hi> a <hi>ſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Liturgy</hi> even in reference to the moſt <hi>ordinary</hi> occaſions of Prayer.</p>
               <p n="5">V. <hi>For what his Lp. adds about the peoples joyning with the Miniſter in repeating of publick Prayer, p.</hi> 36, 37, 38, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That 'tis not deny'd that the people expreſt their joyning in the publick Prayers in Chriſtian Aſſemblys by adding their <hi>Amen</hi> to 'em, as appears from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.16. And if under the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> they added to their <hi>Amen, Hallelujah,</hi> as 106 <hi>Pſ.</hi> 48. or <hi>He is good, for his mercy endures for ever,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.3. It makes no great difference in the matter.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Yet he has brought neither precept nor example from the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> of the peoples <hi>Repeating the Prayer</hi> together with the Miniſter.</p>
               <p>For that paſſage, 4 <hi>Acts</hi> 24. proves no more than a conſent of their minds (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) to that Prayer which was then offer'd up. (And the ſame might be ſaid of his inſtance out of the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 21 <hi>Judges</hi> 2.) And here the Bp. very gravely obtrudes upon us a wonderful conceit of that Aſſembly being inſpir'd, not only to <hi>think the ſame thing, but to utter the ſame words, p.</hi> 37, for which there is no neceſſity from the words, nor indeed any great proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:134578:29"/> For the inſtance of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> it has leſs weight in it. They might <hi>pray together,</hi> tho one only ſpake, and yet both uſe their voices in <hi>ſinging</hi> together. And as the Bp. himſelf obſerves, It might be a <hi>Pſalm</hi> they ſung including both matter of <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>praiſe.</hi> Nor will it follow, that becauſe they might ſing a <hi>Pſalm-prayer,</hi> that they might ſay a <hi>proſe-prayer</hi> together. And 'tis ſtrange that his Lp. ſhou'd produce the 6 <hi>Rev.</hi> 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as an example of peoples joyning their voices in publick Prayer, becauſe we read there of the <hi>ſouls of the Martyrs under the Altar crying with a loud voice, How long, O Lord, holy and true, &amp;c.</hi> For ſure he dos not take <hi>crying with a loud voice</hi> in a literal ſenſe, when ſpoken of departed ſouls that have none. If indeed he cou'd prove that thoſe ſouls had <hi>aetherial vehicles,</hi> and in thoſe <hi>vehicles</hi> were furniſht with or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of ſpeech, this might be a notable argument to his purpoſe. But otherwiſe, That argument he uſes, <hi>p.</hi> 40. from the peoples ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Amen</hi> at the end of the Prayer, is better of the two, tho how it will prove their repeating the whole Prayer, I know not: any more than how the peoples joyning with the Miniſter in <hi>ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> will prove their joyning in thoſe <hi>Prayers</hi> that require no ſuch uſe of their voice. For the <hi>Angels</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> 7 <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. I have ſhewn him his miſtake before. So that he is far from having brought any <hi>clear proof</hi> as he pretends, <hi>p.</hi> 40. to excuſe their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice herein from being <hi>one</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> ſort of <hi>human Inventions.</hi> And tho I am more charitable than to take this advantage to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign it as unlawful, yet I muſt confeſs I am not very fond of it; becauſe it ſeems leſs ſutable to the gravity and ſolemnity of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Worſhip, and brings in a confuſed noiſe in a Chriſtian Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, too like that of a <hi>Dover court,</hi> where 'tis ſaid <hi>all ſpeak,</hi> and <hi>none hear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having conſider'd the <hi>Directions</hi> of the <hi>H.

This <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> they ſuppoſe the effect of the divine bleſſing on our diligent ſtudy and meditation, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent exerciſe in this holy duty. As all other ordinary <hi>Gifts</hi> of the Spirit of God are. For they ſuppoſe the <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> as well as that of <hi>Preaching</hi> capable of falling under Rules for its attainment and exerciſe, and do accordingly highly approve of thoſe which that Judicious Divine Bp. <hi>Wilkins</hi> has laid down in that excellent Diſcourſe he calls his <hi>Gift of Prayer.</hi> That there is ſuch a <hi>Gift</hi> his Lp. himſelf owns, <hi>p.</hi> 46. and <hi>p.</hi> 54. And I ſhall add under this Head, that there are very different degrees of this, as there are of all other <hi>Abilities</hi> and <hi>Gifts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They do indeed ſuppoſe that ordinarily all Miniſters ſhou'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:134578:30"/> people in 'em, is they think a miſerable defect in thoſe whoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it is to <hi>give themſelves continually unto Prayer,</hi> 6 <hi>Acts, v.</hi> 4. and who will but very lamely perform it without ſuch abilities. And therefore Bp. <hi>Wilkins</hi> juſtly cenſures the want of it in them as their great <hi>fault and ſhame.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. They do by no means ſuppoſe every good man to be endued with this <hi>Gift,</hi> much leſs with ſuch a meaſure of it, as will qualify him to perform that duty in his <hi>Family</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of <hi>Forms.</hi> And therefore they often urge ſuch to the uſe of <hi>Forms</hi> in their Families as cannot without ſuch helps keep up that duty in 'em without the hazard of expoſing it to contempt. (Nor do they diſallow all uſe of <hi>forms</hi> in ſecret Prayer it ſelf; tho they think it no way adviſeable for Chriſtians to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine themſelves to 'em in their Cloſet-devotions, ſince they cannot do ſo without ſuppreſſing many deſires ſutable to their preſent condition; Nor can their want of words be a juſt reaſon for their limiting themſelves to ſuch <hi>forms,</hi> ſince they are not needful in ſecret Prayer. Our very groans and ſighs are a language our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father ſufficiently underſtands). But yet they do ſuppoſe the want of this <hi>gift</hi> to be a great defect, and judge ſuch a degree of it ordinarily attainable by continued diligence and exerciſe as is neceſſary to the ſuiting our Family-Prayers to our particular ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and therefore do urge thoſe under their care to endeavour after it. And they do ſuppoſe that the H. Spirit is ready to aſſiſt good men in ſuch endeavors, not only by exciting their devout af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but by enlightning their minds to underſtand their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual neceſsities, by directing 'em in the matter of their Prayers, by bringing the promiſes of God to their remembrance, by ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening and elevating their natural faculties to more vigorous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, by quickning their indiſpoſed minds, and helping 'em a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their manifold infirmities. And ſo much they think inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in what the Apoſtle declares concerning the aſsiſtance of the H. Spirit in this duty, 8 <hi>Rom.</hi> 26. And herein they aſſert no more than the Reverend Bp. <hi>Wilkins</hi> has done before 'em, who not only affirms, That this <hi>Gift,</hi> if ſeriouſly endeavour'd after, may be <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:134578:31"/> in ſome meaſure, by any one that has common capacity, p.</hi> 13. but ſpeaks of ſuch Chriſtians as <hi>ſatisfy themſelves with their Book-prayer, and go no farther as remaining ſtill in their Infancy, p.</hi> 11. and recommends this <hi>gift</hi> even to private Chriſtians from the <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi> of it, from its <hi>ſutableneſs</hi> and <hi>neceſsity</hi> (as being part of our ſpiritual Armour, which 'tis as unbecoming a Chriſtian to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective in, as for a Souldier to be without skill in the uſe of Arms), from its ſpecial <hi>advantages</hi> and <hi>fruits</hi> (as enabling a man on all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to relate his condition, and ſuit his deſires and expreſsions according to ſeveral emergencys), and from the <hi>inconveniences</hi> a man is expos'd to by the want of it, (when being ſurpriz'd with any ſudden exigency or ſtrait he knows not how to relate his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or beſpeak God's aſsiſtance without having recourſe to ſome preſcribed Form, which perhaps has no proper reference to the particular occaſion), <hi>p.</hi> 22, 23, 24. And I cannot better repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our judgment concerning theſe 2 different modes of Praying than in his excellent words. <hi>What one ſaith of Counſel to be had from Books, may be fitly applied to this Prayer by Book. That 'tis commonly of it ſelf ſomething flat and dead, floating for the moſt part too much in generalitys, and not particular enough for each ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral occaſion. There is not that life and vigour in it to engage the affections, as when it proceeds immediately from the ſoul it ſelf, and is the natural expreſſion of thoſe particulars whereof we are moſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And if it be a fault not to ſtrive and labour after this gift, much more is it to jeer and deſpiſe it by the name of</hi> extempore-prayer and praying by the Spirit, <hi>which expreſsions (as they are frequently us'd by ſome men by way of reproach) are for the moſt part the ſign of a profane heart, and ſuch as are altogether ſtrangers from the power and comfort of this duty,</hi> p. 12.</p>
               <p>Thus far that learned and pious Bp. whoſe ſentiments in this matter are, I perceive, very different from his Lp's.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>They are far from excluding premeditation in the exerciſe of this Gift of Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the contrary, they think it ordinarily neceſſary as to the <hi>matter</hi> of our Prayers; Nay, they do not exclude all premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:134578:31"/> as to <hi>words,</hi> any farther than the tying our ſelves to a Form of 'em may ſhut out ſuch ſutable petitions as the Spirit of God may ſuggeſt to our minds in the fervour of our Devotions, which did not occur to 'em in our previous meditation. And therefore they think the name of <hi>extempore,</hi> and much more that of <hi>unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated Prayers,</hi> very unfit to expreſs thoſe which they offer up according to ſuch an <hi>ability</hi> and <hi>gift;</hi> For they ſuppoſe that ſuch as pray with others, eſpecially in publick Aſſemblys, ſhou'd pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare themſelves for it by conſidering before-hand the particular caſes and neceſſities of thoſe that joyn with 'em. And againſt ſuch Prayers I can find nothing in that Text he alledges, <hi>When thou goeſt to the houſe of God, be not raſh with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be haſty to utter any thing before God; For God is in Heaven, and thou upon Earth, therefore let thy words be few,</hi> 5 <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 1, 2. For ſure his Lp. cannot think they enjoyn of Prayers by a preſcrib'd <hi>Liturgy;</hi> For if we pray ſo, there's no need of this caution, that we ſhou'd not be <hi>raſh with our mouth,</hi> and that <hi>our w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

The Text dos indeed properly refer to private vows in the houſe of God, but may by parity of reaſon be ſuppos'd to forbid our Praying without due premeditation, and multiplying our expreſſions without any ſutable affections Which caution we account very neceſſary in all free-prayers, even in private, and much more in publick ones. So that this place affords a much ſtronger Argument for <hi>Free-prayers</hi> than againſt 'em.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. And here I find that ſome of your Writers are of opinion, <hi>that the Spirit of Prayer is given to all the children of God in ſome meaſure, for enabling their hearts to conceive, and their tongues to expreſs convenient deſires to God,</hi> and that therefore Forms of Prayer are of no neceſſary uſe either in publick or private, on the contrary that they ſtint the Spirit, and hinder men from ſtirring up, or uſing that Gift that God has given 'em.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. That the Miniſter is the mouth of the Congregation, and and that he only is to ſpeak publickly to God in behalf of the people, and that they are not to joyn their voices but only their hearts with him.</p>
                  <p>Upon theſe Principles you forſake our Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Firſt, For that poſition of your Directory, <hi>that the Spirit of Prayer is given to all the children of God in ſome meaſure, for enabling their hearts to conceive, and their tongues to expreſs convenient deſires to God,</hi> I entreat you to conſider, what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or foundation it has in Scripture, <hi>&amp;c. and in the ſame p.</hi> 45. This Doctrine is a meer Invention of men, and the Worſhip built on it a vanity in the ſenſe of our Saviour, 7 <hi>Mark</hi> 7. <hi>This
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:134578:32"/> Principle his Lp. largely endeavors to confute from p.</hi> 45. <hi>to p.</hi> 53. <hi>where he calls it the</hi> great Principle of the Diſſenters Worſhip, <hi>and tells the people,</hi> Now, my friends, it lies upon your Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who are of this perſuaſion, to produce plain Scripture for your Principles, or elſe to confeſs, <hi>&amp;c. Again, p.</hi> 62. <hi>he falls ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely on this poor</hi> Principle.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Anſw. I am afraid I ſhall much ſurprize his Lp. when I tell him that I can find no ſuch <hi>Principle,</hi> nor indeed any thing like it either in ſenſe or ſound in the whole <hi>Directory.</hi> I wou'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore entreat him to read it over once more, that he may oblige me with the account of the page where it lies; And I may the more reaſonably requeſt this favour of him, becauſe he has put me to the trouble of reading it twice or thrice over on this occaſion to no purpoſe. And I ſuppoſe the Reverend Compilers of the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory</hi> gave him no commiſſion to coyn <hi>principles</hi> for 'em meerly that he might have the ſatisfaction of confuting 'em. But I'll do him the Juſtice he has not done them, by acquainting the Reader, that upon a ſtrict enquiry, I ſuppoſe his Lp. has miſtaken ſome <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections</hi> of a <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> concerning <hi>ſecret and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Worſhip, &amp;c.</hi> printed there, <hi>A. D.</hi> 1647. for the <hi>Directory</hi> of <hi>publick Worſhip</hi> publiſht by the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter, A. D.</hi> 1644. And if I be in the right in this conjecture, I muſt add, that I cou'd very eaſily forgive him this miſtake, if he had us'd any ſincerity in repreſenting the judgment of that grave and pious <hi>Synod.</hi> But if it appear that he has obtruded upon 'em an Opinion which they no way aſſert, nay which the paſſage from whence he draws it is rather inconſiſtent with, then the beſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy he can make for himſelf, is to own his miſtake, and to make 'em ſome reparation for ſo groſs an abuſe. And whether this be not the true Account of the matter, I leave the Reader to judge, when he compares the words of the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> with the <hi>Opinion</hi> the Bp. aſcribes to 'em.</p>
               <p>In the fore-mentioned <hi>directions</hi> of that <hi>Aſſembly</hi> concerning <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>Family-Worſhip, p.</hi> 9. <hi>Direct.</hi> 9. are theſe words,</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:134578:33"/>
               <p>
                  <q>So many as can conceive Prayer, ought to make uſe of that Gift of God, Albeit theſe who are rude and weaker may begin at a ſett Form of Prayer, but ſo as they be not ſluggiſh in ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up in themſelves (according to their daily neceſſities) the Spirit of Prayer, which is given to all the children of God in ſome meaſure; To which effect they ought to be more fervent and frequent in ſecret Prayer to God, for enabling their hearts to conceive, and their tongues to expreſs convenient deſires for their Family.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now if theſe be the words his Lp. refers to, I wou'd deſire him to conſider a little better, how he can deduce this <hi>principle</hi> out of 'em, <hi>viz. That the Spirit of Prayer is given to all the children of God in ſome meaſure, for enabling their hearts to conceive, and their tongues to expreſs convenient deſires to God, and as his Lp. adds, p.</hi> 53. <hi>without a Form.</hi> For the Bp. hereby ſuppoſes that this Aſſembly thought that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Prayer was the <hi>Gift</hi> of Prayer, and that this <hi>Gift</hi> was in ſome meaſure given to all the children of God, to enable 'em to pray <hi>without a Form.</hi> And therefore what the <hi>Aſsembly</hi> calls <hi>ſtirring up in themſelves the Spirit of Prayer,</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains by <hi>ſtirring up the Gift, p.</hi> 44. And accordingly his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt 'em, all run on this ſuppoſition, that they oppoſe praying by the <hi>Spirit</hi> to praying by a <hi>Form,</hi> and imagin the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> and <hi>Gift</hi> of Prayer to be the ſame thing, and accordingly he makes <hi>decency of expreſſion a part of the Spirit of Prayer, p.</hi> 46.</p>
               <p>Now what can be more oppoſite to the words and ſcope of that <hi>Aſſembly?</hi> Do they not diſtinguiſh Chriſtians into 2 ſorts ſuch as are more <hi>judicious</hi> and <hi>ſtrong,</hi> and ſuch as are more <hi>rude</hi> and <hi>weak?</hi> Is it not the <hi>form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r</hi> whom they ſuppoſe to have the <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Prayer?</hi> And do they not ſuppoſe the <hi>latter</hi> to be at preſent deſtitute of that <hi>gift,</hi> and (as Bp. <hi>Wilkins</hi> expreſſes it) to <hi>need Forms as impotent people do crutches?</hi> they do indeed ſay the <hi>ſpirit of prayer, (i. e.</hi> a devout and praying diſpoſition) is given in ſome meaſure to all the children of God. But they do not ſuppoſe therefore that all who have the <hi>ſpirit of prayer</hi> have the <hi>gift</hi> alſo, but the quite contrary. All that their words can be reaſonably
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:134578:33"/> extended to import, is, That whereas there are manifold daily ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of Chriſtian Families which preſcribed Forms cannot ſuit, 'tis a great infelicity to be unable to expreſs our deſires to God in thoſe caſes; And therefore ſuch as labour under that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, ſhou'd be earneſt to beg of God ſuch an ability and gift, ſo far as 'tis neceſſary for their due diſcharge of this duty to the edification and comfort of their Familys; that they ought in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the attainment of it to cheriſh the ſpirit of Prayer, <hi>i. e.</hi> thoſe devout deſires and affections which the ſpirit of God communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates in ſome meaſure to all his children, according to their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious neceſſities, and which cannot but be greatly hindred and dampt when our inability confines us wholly to the uſe of Forms, which cannot ſuit the particular condition of our ſelves and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. And they ſuppoſe that ſuch an ability to pray ſutably to our particular neceſſities, is one of the ordinary gifts of the H. Spirit, which private Chriſtians ſhou'd beg of God, and have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to hope for (ſo far as 'tis neceſſary to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance with his general commands of <hi>making known their requeſts to him in every thing</hi>) in the diligent uſe of ſuch helps as they are furniſht with, and frequent exerciſing themſelves in this excellent duty. Their words alſo do imply, that the more we grow in a devout and praying diſpoſition, the more eaſily may we attain ſome meaſure of that Gift, ſince <hi>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaks,</hi> and the more we feel our own ſpiritual neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the more eaſily dos the pinching ſenſe of 'em ſupply us with expreſſions and arguments in pleading with God for relief of 'em. And as this is all that can be drawn from their words without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering violence to 'em, ſo 'tis no more than (as I have ſhewn him) Bp. <hi>Wilkins</hi> aſſerts, and if his Lp. have any thing to object againſt any of theſe Aſſertions which are genuinely deduc'd from their words, I ſhall be very glad to hear it; But for the <hi>Poſition</hi> he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes to that <hi>Aſſembly</hi> as laid down and expounded by him, 'tis his <hi>own,</hi> and not <hi>theirs;</hi> And therefore 'tis he is concern'd to prove it, and ſeems not to deal ſo ingenuouſly as he ſhou'd, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting ſo ſcornfully over his own <hi>man of ſtraw.</hi> For all his grave
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:134578:34"/> Reaſonings concern no avowed <hi>Principle</hi> of the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and his diſcourſe (from <hi>p.</hi> 46. to <hi>p.</hi> 57.) on this head, is ſo far from being <hi>grateful and inſtructive to the Readers of all ſorts,</hi> (as he imagins, <hi>p.</hi> 49) that it rather nauſeates all judicious Readers to find his Lp. when he pretends to explain theſe matters, and ſet 'em in ſo clear a light, ſo miſerably confound thoſe 2 things, the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Gift</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> which all accurate Writers on both ſides ſo carefully diſtinguiſh, and muſt neceſſarily do ſo, unleſs they have a mind to fight with ſhadows, and contend in the dark without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding one another. And therefore becauſe he may deſpiſe our Inſtructions, I wou'd deſire his Lp. before he writes any more on this ſubject, to read the 3 firſt Chapters of Bp. <hi>Wilkins Gift</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> which he will find wrote with admirable judgment, and much more <hi>grateful</hi> and <hi>Inſtructive</hi> than thoſe crude and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted Notions he has here offer'd.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral paſſages in what he ſaith on this pretended Principle of the <hi>Diſsenters,</hi> which I have elſewhere taken notice of, and ſhall only add, that whereas, <hi>p.</hi> 45. he tells us, <hi>There is no Command in Scripture requiring us to worſhip or pray to God in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd extemporary or unpremeditated Form, or ſo much as an example in a ſettl'd ordinary Congregation, where it was practis'd,</hi> I hope I have already ſaid enough to ſatisfy an unprejudic'd Reader, that God's commands, in reference to Prayer, do certainly enjoyn free prayer, that there is not the leaſt command to pray in general by ſett Forms, that there is no command for the uſe of any particular Form, unleſs the <hi>Lord's-Prayer,</hi> which yet is but doubtful; And that there are more examples of <hi>free prayer</hi> in Scripture, than of <hi>Prayer</hi> by <hi>preſcrib'd Forms;</hi> That there is not the leaſt evidence of any <hi>preſcribed Liturgy</hi> us'd in the Apoſtles time, or in the 2 or 3 ſucceeding ages, and conſequently there is great reaſon to conclude they us'd <hi>free prayer,</hi> or pray'd in the exerciſe of their abilities and gifts; ſo that we have far more probable grounds to conclude pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd <hi>Liturgies</hi> of human compoſure deſtitute of ſcriptural <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>pt</hi> and <hi>example;</hi> And if his Lp. will on that account cenſure 'em as an <hi>human Invention,</hi> and a piece of vain Worſhip, he may uſe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:134578:34"/> his liberty. For I ſhall ſatisfy my ſelf with defending our <hi>own</hi> practice without ſuch harſh Reflections of that of <hi>others.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>P.</hi> 50. His Lp. aſſerts without the leaſt proof, <hi>That Moſes, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, and our Saviour us'd Forms of Prayer.</hi> For the Inſtance that relates to our Saviour, it has been already conſider'd.</p>
               <p>So when, <hi>p.</hi> 52. he ſhou'd prove that <hi>H. men in Scripture reduc'd their Prayers into Forms before they offer'd 'em up in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he dos not produce one inſtance relating to <hi>Prayer</hi> in <hi>proſe,</hi> about which the only diſpute lies, much leſs dos he produce any inſtance of their uſing <hi>Forms</hi> of ſuch <hi>Prayers</hi> compos'd by <hi>other men,</hi> and thoſe uninſpired perſons too.</p>
               <p>His Lp. having examin'd this firſt Principle he charges the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> with, proceeds to the</p>
               <p>Second, <hi>That all Forms of Prayer are unlawful to Chriſtians, and that 'tis a ſin to joyn in a Worſhip where they are us'd, or ſo much as to be preſent at it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this <hi>Principle</hi> his Lp. takes the pains to confute, from <hi>p.</hi> 57. to <hi>p.</hi> 65. I do indeed perceive that he was better advis'd than to quote any Writer among the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> for this ſtrange opinion. But ſince in his laborious confutation of it he all along ſuppoſes ſome conſiderable part of the <hi>Diſsenters</hi> to be maintainers of it, I muſt freely tell his Lp. that unleſs he can produce ſome one Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor at leaſt that has aſſerted any ſuch <hi>Principle,</hi> I muſt make bold to charge the breach of the 9th Command upon him, and hope he'll either produce us ſome teſtimonies of ſuch as avow and maintain it, or do us the juſtice of retracting ſo groſs a calumny. For my own part, I never yet met with any one perſon amongſt either their Miniſters or their people, that ever entertain'd ſo wild and unreaſonable an Opinion. Nor indeed can they entertain it without plainly condemning their own continual practice.</p>
               <p>Dos he not know that the <hi>Diſsenters</hi> call'd <hi>Congregational</hi> as well as thoſe call'd <hi>Presbyterian</hi> do every meeting diſmiſs the people with a Form of Prayer, I <hi>mean</hi> the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Bleſſing, <hi>The Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Love of God, and the Communion of the H. Spirit be with you all, Amen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 14. And can he deny
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:134578:35"/> this to be a Form of Prayer, when the ſolemn <hi>Bleſsing</hi> among the Jews 6 <hi>Numb.</hi> 23. which <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons were order'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, is one of his Lordſhip's chief inſtances of a preſcribed <hi>Form</hi> of Prayer? So that if there be any <hi>Diſſenters</hi> of the Opinion his Lordſhip attributes to 'em, they ſhou'd renounce Communion with their own Churches, and much more with the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Churches, among whom larger Forms are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently us'd, which he knows they are far from doing, whatever others may have done, who ſo uncharitably unchurch 'em for want of Prelatical Ordination. I have already told him that the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory</hi> recommends the <hi>Lord's Prayer</hi> as a <hi>Form,</hi> and ſuch Forms of Prayer were drawn up for publick uſe by the NC Divines at the <hi>Savoy</hi> in their Propoſals for Accommodation, (and indeed the moſt unexceptionable ones I have yet ſeen, as conſiſting almoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely of ſcriptural expreſſions); Nay even thoſe who are moſt ſevere in condemning ſtinted <hi>Liturgys,</hi> do it not, becauſe they think Forms of Prayer unlawful, but becauſe they look on the confining all publick Prayers to ſuch <hi>preſcribed Forms,</hi> as a perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Engine to exclude the exerciſe of that <hi>Ability</hi> or <hi>Gift</hi> with which all duly qualifi'd Miniſters are endu'd for Prayer as well as Preaching, nay to exclude many occaſional requeſts which ſuch ſett Forms cou'd make no particular proviſion for. So that the whole of what he has ſaid from <hi>p.</hi> 57. to <hi>p.</hi> 65. dos no more concern the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> than himſelf, and 'tis eaſy for his Lp. to triumph when he meets with no Adverſary.</p>
               <p>And yet there are ſome things in his confutation of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Principle very liable to exception. As to inſtance in two.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Since it appears by the foregoing Remarks that God has no more commanded our Praying with a Form than without one, he ſhou'd, if he had been impartial, have repreſented the contrary Opinion of the <hi>unlawfulneſs</hi> of <hi>free prayer,</hi> to be of altogether as dangerous conſequence as that which he confutes, and he'll find that the beſt arguments he brings againſt the latter, are altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as valid againſt the former. For that former Opinion wou'd have divided men from the Communion of the whole Church
<pb facs="tcp:134578:35"/> in its firſt and pureſt Ages; And the forbidding <hi>free-prayer</hi> is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with as many pernicious eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cts as the forbidding of <hi>Forms,</hi> and perhaps more, ſo that the Devil may have altogether as ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til and dangerous deſigns to drive on by ſeducing men to the <hi>one</hi> of theſe miſtakes as to the <hi>other,</hi> Nay this Opinion of the <hi>unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs</hi> of <hi>free-prayer</hi> may as much tend to flatter men with a good opinion of themſelves, as if they diſcharg'd that duty ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, when, like the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> they have run over their <hi>Beads;</hi> As the other Opinion can tempt men to think they are partakers of the <hi>ſanctifying influences</hi> of the <hi>H. Spirit,</hi> becauſe they partake of a <hi>common Gift;</hi> And I am ſure the condemning <hi>free-prayer</hi> has a far more pernicious influence to hinder ſecret devotion. For in <hi>free-prayer</hi> a man needs not expreſs his deſires in words at all, and therefore need not forbear praying for want of a <hi>Form,</hi> whereas if he omit <hi>free-prayer,</hi> he muſt rarely ever ſuit that part of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions to his particular circumſtances and condition.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As his Lp. has ſufficiently wrong'd the <hi>Diſsenters</hi> by falſly imputing ſuch a <hi>Principle</hi> to 'em, ſo he has greatly added to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, by telling the world, <hi>That on this account the pious cuſtom of training up young people to a conſtant courſe of Devotion in their morning and evening ſecret prayers is too univerſally laid aſide among the Diſſenters, as he has found by experience, and for the truth of the obſervation, he ſaith he dare appeal to all of the Diſsenters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. What is it that a man who is grown remarkable for his Talent of <hi>aſſerting boldly,</hi> dare not venture on? But ſure he cannot hope by meer confidence to perſuade us out of our ſenſes. And therefore ſince he appeals to us in this matter, we muſt needs tell him, We take what he aſſerts to be contrary to undoubted matter of Fact; For we know of no Proteſtants in the world that more univerſally urge all in their Families to conſtant ſecret pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the <hi>Diſsenters;</hi> And we cou'd wiſh there were (propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to the numbers on each ſide) one of their Communion for five or ten of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> that maintain daily Family-prayer. I know compariſons are odious, and therefore ſhou'd never have made this, if his Lp's groſs partiality had not extorted it, who in
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:134578:36"/> this charge has ſeem'd to lay aſide all regard to truth, or indeed to any appearance and ſhew of it. It were very deſirable that ſome of our <hi>Convocations</hi> wou'd take as effectual a courſe to promote <hi>ſecret,</hi> and <hi>Family-devotion</hi> as that <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> (on whoſe words he wou'd have obtruded his firſt pretended Principle of the Diſſenters) who not only adviſe all particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to prayer and meditation, but enjoyn <hi>Paſtors to preſs it on all under their charge,</hi> and <hi>the Heads of Familys to have a care that both themſelves and all within their charge be daily diligent therein.</hi> Directions, <hi>&amp;c. p.</hi> 1. And I can hear of no Miniſters that ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently urge this duty on their People as theirs. Nor do I know of any among the Diſſenters that ſcruple the teaching their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the <hi>Lord's Prayer</hi> or other ſhort <hi>Forms,</hi> tho they may perhaps take more pains than others to prevent their ſaying 'em by rote without underſtanding 'em. But I wonder much what his Lp. means when he tells us ſo gravely, <hi>p.</hi> 64. <hi>As for children and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people among thoſe of this perſuaſion, I am well aſſured, many of 'em never bow their knees in ſecret to God, and ſeveral of thoſe that are grown up are forc'd to ſpeak aloud, or cannot pray at all, which is againſt the nature of ſecret-prayer, and expoſes not only the perſon that uſes it to the cenſure of hypocriſy, but the duty to contempt.</hi> I ſhall not now enquire how he is aſſur'd of what they do, or do not in ſecret; Nor need he ſure be told, that there are too many children and ignorant people in their Communion as well as that of the Diſſenters, that after all the pains taken to perſuade 'em to their duty, do yet neglect it; But ſure there is ſome ſtrange myſtery in what he aſſerts of thoſe that are grown up, if we cou'd but find it out.

               <p>I ſhall only ſuggeſt concerning it, That 'tis true we think the <hi>Miniſter</hi> is the <hi>Mouth of the Congregation,</hi> and can find neither <hi>precept</hi> or <hi>pattern</hi> in Scripture for the Congregation's <hi>repeating a whole prayer</hi> together with the Miniſter, much leſs of their ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the words between 'em, as that the people rather make the Prayer, (as in moſt Petitions of she <hi>Litany</hi>); nor dos the paſſage he alledges from 15 <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. prove any ſuch thing; And therefore on his weak Principles we might condemn their practice in this point as unlawful; But we are far from being ſo raſh and forward in our blind cenſures as he groundleſly inſinuates, <hi>p.</hi> 66. Nor do we (as he here aſſerts) ſuppoſe that the people have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but to joyn in their hearts with the Miniſter, but ſuppoſe their adding their <hi>Amen</hi> a fit teſtimony of their aſſent to the publick Prayers they joyn in, and he may in the Morning-Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Having examin'd his Lp's unjuſt Account of their <hi>Principles,</hi> I think it requiſite to add a few things relating to</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Their general practice;</hi> Concerning which I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuggeſt</p>

Such as follow the <hi>Directory,</hi> tho they are not confin'd to the words there propos'd, yet look on 'em as the <hi>patterns</hi> to which the ordinary part of their Prayers ſhou'd be conform'd. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, The <hi>Directory</hi> dos require Miniſters to pray to that effect; Nor dos it diſallow the uſe of thoſe very expreſsions, where the defectiveneſs of the Miniſter's Gifts, or his unpreparedneſs by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation renders it moſt conducive to publick edification. So that neither are ſuch Miniſters left arbitrarily to choice as to the moſt ſtated and conſtant matters of Prayer, nor the people left wholly at uncertainty about 'em.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All Forms of Words in publick Worſhip are not diſus'd by 'em.</p>
               <p>They conſtantly uſe our Saviour's words, 2 S <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>I Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize thee in the Name, &amp;c.</hi> in that <hi>Ordinance.</hi> So do they retain his own words in the delivering the <hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>Cup</hi> in the <hi>Lord's-Supper</hi> (tho, by the way, our Service-Book has ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly alter'd and transform'd 'em into a Prayer, for which I hope his Lp. will cenſure the Compilers of it, as having preferr'd their own <hi>Invention</hi> before <hi>Chriſt's Inſtitution</hi>). So when they give the <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> (which is a Prayer) they do it uſually in ſome of the <hi>Apoſtolical Forms</hi> mention'd in the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> Several of 'em uſe the <hi>Lord's-Prayer</hi> as a <hi>Form,</hi> according to the advice of the <hi>Directory.</hi> And for thoſe that diſuſe it, 'tis becauſe they either think it no Form ſuited to the Chriſtian Church after Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Aſcention, or elſe think it not intended as a <hi>Form</hi> but only a <hi>Pattern,</hi> becauſe they never read afterwards in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> of its being us'd as a Form. Nay perhaps ſome may be too much led to the diſuſe of it, in oppoſition to the contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme of others, who place ſome peculiar merit or vertue in the repeating theſe words. And his Lp. ſeems to be one that has run into this extreme, not only by ſuppoſing us oblig'd to uſe theſe words whenever we pray, <hi>p.</hi> 32, 33. and making the uſe of 'em a Badge of our Chriſtian Profeſſion, <hi>p.</hi> 35. but by recommending the ſaying theſe words as the <hi>way to obtain pardon for our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in our other prayers, p.</hi> 34. But I wonder who thoſe are of whom
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:134578:37"/> his Lp. tells us that they publickly diſpute againſt this <hi>Form,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that Petition in it, <hi>Forgive us our Treſpaſses as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us, p.</hi> 34. For I cou'd never hear of any ſuch publick <hi>Diſputation</hi> on that Subject, nor indeed of any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter that ever offer'd ſuch a fooliſh Objection; ſome of 'em per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may have cenſur'd thoſe as hypocritical in the uſe of this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, who are ſo far from forgiving their enemies, as to bear an irreconcilable temper towards their Friends and their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The true Reaſon, why the Diſſenting Miniſters ſo generally diſuſe Forms of Prayer compos'd by others, is not, becauſe they judge all Forms of Prayer unlawful, but becauſe they think free-prayer gives 'em the advantage to ſuit this part of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations better to the Edification of their people.</p>
               <p>And they are very much confirm'd in this Opinion, both by what they obſerve in the H. Scriptures, and by experience.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>H. Scriptures,</hi> They not only find no ſuch ſtinted <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgys</hi> preſcrib'd either by <hi>Chriſt</hi> or his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but no orders given to any <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the Church to compoſe 'em for others, much leſs any warrant to enjoyn the uſe of 'em. They think it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt probable, if not certain, that even ordinary Paſtors in the Apoſtles time, and in ſome Ages after us'd <hi>free-prayer, i. e.</hi> their publick Prayers as well as Sermons were the exerciſe of thoſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gifts and Abilities with which they were furniſht for their miniſterial Office, and not a meer repetition or reading of <hi>Forms</hi> preſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ribed to 'em by others. Nay, they think the confining Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors to ſuch preſcribed Forms, renders 'em incapable of comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the general Rules of Scripture, that require us to ſuit our Prayers to all particular emergent occaſions, which the Biſhop himſelf owns cannot well be done without the uſe of <hi>free</hi> (or as he calls 'em) <hi>extempore-prayers, p.</hi> 54. They think it therefore every way the ſafeſt to come herein as near as poſſible to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Chriſtian Church in the Apoſtles time, and thoſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages wherein it retain'd moſt of its primitive purity.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:134578:38"/>
               <p>Nor are they leſs ſtrengthened in their judgment by <hi>experience,</hi> on which ſome ſtreſs may be juſtly laid when we are to determine the modes of Worſhip (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. <hi>In reference to Miniſters.</hi> For as in thoſe Chriſtian Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys where Preaching has been diſus'd, and Forms of Inſtruction and Exhortation (call'd <hi>Homilys,</hi> or <hi>Sermons</hi>) provided for the Clergy, they have by this uſe of 'em, ſunk into general ignorance and ſloth, and taken little pains to furniſh themſelves with abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to inſtruct their people; So, where ſtinted <hi>Liturgys</hi> have been impos'd, the Clergy, by the conſtant uſe of 'em, generally ſo habituate themſelves to theſe <hi>Crutches,</hi> that they are unable to go without 'em, and find themſelves at a great loſs, when they ſhou'd accommodate their publick or private prayers to that great variety of particular occaſions wherein they ſhou'd be the mouth of their people in their addreſſes to God. Whereas the conſtant exerciſe of their abilities in publick <hi>Prayer</hi> as well as <hi>Preaching</hi> greatly improves 'em, and furniſhes 'em for aſſiſting their Flocks with their prayers in all thoſe manifold neceſſities, in which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Forms are no more pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:134578:38"/> Tune is tedious to a muſical Ear, whereas a ſutable variety tends more to raiſe and elevate 'em. And tho perhaps ſome few very devout perſons may avoid this inconvenience of conſtant publick Forms, yet it ſeems incurable in the generality of the people, whoſe caſe muſt be chiefly conſider'd, when we conſult their Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication in determining the particular modes of Worſhip.</p>
               <p>I will not diſown that there are ſome inconveniencys on the other ſide, which I ſhall propoſe with the ſame freedom, and offer my thoughts of 'em.</p>
               <p>'Tis indeed true as the Bp. ſuggeſts, <hi>p.</hi> 41. that in a ſtinted <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy</hi> the <hi>people are more exactly acquainted before-hand with the words of the Prayer they are to joyn in,</hi> than when the Miniſter is left to the exerciſe of his own Abilities. But as this inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence relates rather to the words than the ordinary matter of our Prayers, ſo how little weight there is in the argument drawn thence againſt <hi>free-prayer,</hi> I refer the Reader to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent reply given to it by the fore-mentioned Bp. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gift of Prayer, p. <hi>12.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Whereas</hi> (ſaith that pious Author) <hi>'tis commonly objected by ſome, That they cannot ſo well joyn in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Form (For ſo he calls free-prayer in reſpect of thoſe that hear it) with which they are not before-hand acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; I anſwer, That's an inconſiderable Objection, and dos oppoſe all kind of Forms that are not publickly preſcrib'd. As a man may in his judgment aſsent unto any divine Truth deliver'd in a Sermon which he never heard before, ſo may he joyn in his affections to a holy deſire in a Prayer which he never heard before. If he who is the Mouth of the reſt deliver thro imprudence what we cannot approve of, God dos not look upon it as our Prayer, if our deſires do not ſay Amen to it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the main inconvenience ariſes from the <hi>danger of ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oſing the duty to contempt by unbeſeeming expreſsions, which men of weak judgments often fall into,</hi> Of which his Lp. gives us a hint, <hi>p.</hi> 56. and (give him his due) expreſſes himſelf with great modeſty and truly Chriſtian prudence on that occaſion, where the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and indecencys of ſome might perhaps have given him ſome real advantage to expoſe 'em. But as to this I ſhall only ſuggeſt,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:134578:39"/> That I think ſuch as are incapable of uſing free-prayer without apparent hazard of rendring it contemptible by their indecent manner of performing it, ſhou'd no more be admitted to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Office, than thoſe that cannot Preach without the ſame danger. Or at leaſt, that where no better can be had, ſuch ſhou'd rather (according to the direction the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> fore-mention'd gives to Maſters of Familys) begin with ſome good <hi>Forms,</hi> till by ſtudy and exerciſe they are capable to do better.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid thus much in reference to our <hi>practice,</hi> I ſhall only ſubjoyn as to that of the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That for perſons uninſpir'd to compoſe Forms of Prayer, and impoſe the uſe of 'em upon others, is neither warranted by ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>precept</hi> or <hi>pattern,</hi> and is in the Bp's ſenſe only an <hi>human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention.</hi> But to confine all publick Prayers to ſuch preſcribed Forms, is inconſiſtent with the general Rules of the <hi>H. Scriptures</hi> relating to this duty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Reading</hi> of publick Prayer, (I mean <hi>Proſe</hi> not <hi>Pſalm-prayers</hi>) has neither <hi>precept</hi> nor <hi>example</hi> in the Word of God, nor indeed in the practice of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> in which it was the common cuſtom to pray, either with their eyes ſhut or lifted up towards Heaven. And indeed this practice tends ſo much to dull the affections of thoſe that joyn in this duty, that 'tis great pitty that thoſe who for want of the <hi>gift of prayer,</hi> are obliged to uſe Forms, ſhou'd not at leaſt be furniſht with the <hi>gift of memory</hi> to repeat 'em without Book.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I think the Arguments us'd in the grand Debate at the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> againſt the frequent Repetitions in the <hi>Litany,</hi> and the ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Collects as defects that needed being reform'd have never yet been well anſwer'd.</p>
               <p>And now I ſhall conclude this Chapter, by taking a little no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the wonderful <hi>diſcovery</hi> the Biſhop has made of that double <hi>Artifice</hi> or Trick the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> uſe, to make <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> of their <hi>own</hi> paſs with the people for <hi>extempore-ones;</hi> The <hi>one</hi> by <hi>compoſing ſeveral Forms, and committing 'em to memory, and then tranſpoſing the ſeveral parts of 'em;</hi> The <hi>other,</hi> by <hi>remembring the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:134578:39"/> ſeveral ways they have tried in their ſecret prayers to expreſs the ſame thing, p.</hi> 55, 56. As to which, I ſhall only obſerve, That the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> have ſome reaſon to take it unkindly that he ſhou'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their ſecrets to the world; But this is a piece of treachery that muſt always be expected from thoſe that <hi>deſert</hi> their own <hi>Party,</hi> and have no other way to ingratiate themſelves with their <hi>new friends.</hi> Only they wonder why he ſhou'd ſtrive to make two <hi>ſecrets</hi> of one; For they cannot clearly diſcern any gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

His Lp. wou'd do well to examin his <hi>Criticiſms</hi> a little better before he aſſert 'em ſo confidently; For there is none of theſe new ones he here offers, but ſeem liable to very ſtrong ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, which I ſhou'd be glad to hear his ſolution of.</p>
            <p>For againſt his new Notion of the ſenſe of the word <hi>Preaching</hi> in the New Teſtament, I wou'd propoſe this obvious one; The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in writing his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> ſtyles thoſe to whom he directs it, <hi>Belov'd of God</hi> and <hi>call'd to be Saints,</hi> and Thanks God that <hi>their Faith was ſpoken of throughout the whole world, v.</hi> 7, 8. And yet he tells 'em that <hi>he often purpoſed to come to 'em, but was let hitherto, v.</hi> 13. and adds, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>So much as is in me I am ready to preach the Goſpel to you that are at Rome alſo.</hi> And here is the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Let us then apply it to one of theſe two ways of <hi>Preaching,</hi> to which the Bp. has confin'd the ſenſe of that word. It cannot be underſtood of <hi>declaring the Goſpell to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe that never heard it before,</hi> For he tells us, <hi>Their Faith had been ſpoken of throughout the whole World;</hi> So that the Goſpel cou'd
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:134578:41"/> be no new tidings to 'em. He muſt then (if the Bp's <hi>Criticiſm</hi> be true) mean no more, than that he often purpos'd to ſee 'em, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>as much as in him was, he was ready to read 'em ſome Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters out of the Old Teſtament at</hi> Rome <hi>alſo.</hi> Now if this were his main errand and buſineſs there, he need not have been ſo much concern'd about the matter. The diſappointment of his purpoſe cou'd be no great prejudice to 'em, unleſs he ſuppos'd they had none among 'em able to read. Nor needed he ſpeak of his read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Chapter as ſo difficult a thing, <hi>which he was ready to do as much as in him lay.</hi> 'Tis plain then the Apoſtle was a ſtranger to the Bp's notion of <hi>Preaching;</hi> for he thought inſtructing thoſe more fully in the doctrine of Chriſtianity who had already em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd it, might be fitly call'd by this name.</p>
            <p>So when he tells us, <hi>Preaching is diſtinguiſht from Teaching,</hi> How hard is it to reconcile this with the following Texts. We read in the 28 <hi>Acts, v.</hi> 30, 31. That <hi>Paul</hi> abode two years at <hi>Rome, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the kingdom of God, and teaching thoſe things which concern the Lord J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſus Chriſt.</hi> So that the Bp. is very curious to diſtinguiſh thoſe two expreſſions which the Inſpired Hiſtorian plainly took for ſynonimous ones. So the ſame Writer gives us an account of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s Speech to the Elders at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> in which what he calls teaching 'em, 20 <hi>Acts, v.</hi> 20 he calls <hi>teach<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and preaching the kingdom of God among 'em, v.</hi> 25. And in both theſe places the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is us'd, and in this latter a phraſe of the ſame import too with the other, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But perhaps an argument drawn from intereſt may prevail above any other. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.14. <hi>the Lord hath ordained that thoſe who preach the Goſpel ſhou'd live of the Goſpel.</hi> This Text he knows is generally applyed by Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors to prove a maintenance due to ordinary Miniſters. And Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> particularly by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here, underſtands the reward of good tidings. But if ordinary Paſtors of the Church have no other way now left of <hi>preaching the Goſpel,</hi> but <hi>reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi> (as according to the Bp's notion they have not) I am afraid the people wou'd ſadly grudge 'em ſo large Revenues on the bare
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:134578:42"/> account of ſuch <hi>Preaching.</hi> But if he'll give the Apoſtle leave to explain his own meaning, he'll find that <hi>preaching</hi> is the ſame thing with <hi>Teaching,</hi> or inſtructing the people in the Chriſtian Doctrine; For 'tis ſo explain'd in thoſe two parallel places, 6 <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. <hi>Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teaches in all good things.</hi> And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well be accounted worthy of double honour, eſpecially them that labour in word and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</hi> If theſe be parallel Texts, as Expoſitors have hitherto ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken 'em to be; then to <hi>teach, to labour in word and doctrine,</hi> are the ſame thing as to <hi>preach.</hi> And by the way, if the reward of good tidings be due to thoſe that <hi>preach the Goſpel,</hi> and if <hi>Readers</hi> be now the only <hi>Preachers</hi> of it in a Chriſtian Kingdom (as the Bp's notion ſuppoſes) how come things to be ſo unequally manag'd, and ſo contrary to the Apoſtle's direction, that they get the leaſt ſhare of the <hi>Reward</hi> for it? Why are theſe true <hi>laborious preachers</hi> put off with ſo ſtingy an allowance, while thoſe Biſhops that in his ſenſe never <hi>preach</hi> at all, engroſs the double honour to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, both the <hi>Dignity</hi> and the <hi>Revenues</hi> which belong to ſuch as <hi>preach the Goſpel?</hi> I ſhall only add the following Texts; I hope the Bp. will grant that our Saviour commiſſion'd his Apoſtles to <hi>preach</hi> when he ſent 'em to diſciple all Nations, 28 <hi>Matth.</hi> two laſt <hi>ver.</hi> And yet he enjoyns 'em to teach 'em all things he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> accordingly in the ſame verſe calls himſelf a <hi>preacher</hi> and a <hi>teacher,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 1.11. And theſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are plainly us'd as equivalent ones, 5 <hi>Acts</hi> 42. And they cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not to <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>preach Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> So 15 <hi>Acts, v.</hi> 35.</p>
            <p>Again, he tells us, <hi>That preaching is diſtinguiſht from exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Now I think we have no reaſon to imagin the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood any ſuch diſtinction, when he exhorts <hi>Timothy,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 4.2. to <hi>preach</hi> the word (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>to be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon,</hi> to <hi>reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-ſuffering and doctrine.</hi> For theſe latter expreſſions ſeem to explain the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. And I hope he will allow the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> to have preacht, in the 2 <hi>Acts</hi> from the 14th to the 40th <hi>ver.</hi> And yet what he ſpoke is call'd an <hi>Exhortation, v.</hi> 40. Nay, to put the matter out
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:134578:42"/> of doubt, 'tis ſaid of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, 3 <hi>Luke</hi> 18. That many other things in his <hi>Exhortation</hi> he <hi>preached</hi> unto the people. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Again he ſaith, <hi>That interpreting the Scriptures, applying 'em, and exhorting the people from 'em in a Chriſtian Auditory, is never call'd Preaching.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now either thoſe many diſcourſes of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> recorded in the <hi>Acts</hi> are not <hi>Preaching,</hi> or elſe quite contrary to the Bp's notion, <hi>Preaching</hi> was <hi>interpreting the ſcriptures, applying 'em,</hi> and <hi>exhorting</hi> the people from 'em. For I would fain know what elſe he can make of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter's Sermon,</hi> 2 <hi>Acts,</hi> from the 14th to the 40th. 3 <hi>Acts,</hi> from the 12th to the end. 4 <hi>Acts,</hi> from the 8th to the 20th. Of <hi>Stephen</hi>'s, 7 <hi>Acts.</hi> Of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>'s, 10 <hi>Acts,</hi> from the 34th to the 44th. Of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s, 13 <hi>Acts,</hi> in which ſingle inſtance, the Bp. will find almoſt all his Notions over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown together. For, <hi>v.</hi> 15. After the reading the Law and Prophets, the Rulers of the <hi>Synagogue</hi> ſend to <hi>Paul</hi> and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany this Meſſage, <hi>Ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation for the people, ſay on.</hi> The Apoſtle addreſſes himſelf to comply with their propoſal. And accordingly his diſcourſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains an <hi>Explication</hi> of ſeveral paſſages out of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> relating to the promiſed ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> an <hi>application</hi> of 'em to our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour,</hi> and an <hi>exhortation</hi> to 'em from thence to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, and not deſpiſe and reject him. And this very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe the Apoſtle calls <hi>declaring glad tidings,</hi> (or <hi>preaching,</hi> for the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>v.</hi> 32. If the Bp. object this diſcourſe was not in a <hi>Chriſtian Auditory,</hi> 'tis eaſily anſwer'd, What can the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the <hi>Auditory</hi> ſignify to alter the nature of the diſcourſe, As if the very ſame diſcourſe in a <hi>Synagogue</hi> ſhou'd be <hi>preaching,</hi> but quite another thing in a <hi>Chriſtian Church.</hi> 'Tis plain here that the Apoſtle <hi>preacht</hi> when he <hi>interpreted the Scriptures relating to Chriſt, applyed</hi> 'em, and <hi>exhorted</hi> the people from 'em, ſo that theſe are the ſame thing. And if he ſtill pretend that ſuch <hi>Expoſition</hi> and <hi>Application</hi> had ſome other name given it when us'd in a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Auditory</hi> than that of <hi>preaching;</hi> I ſhall, to remove this ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:134578:43"/> of a pretence, farther add, I ſuppoſe he will not doubt, but the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> either found, or at leaſt planted a <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> long before his two years expir'd, and yet he is all that time ſaid to <hi>preach the kingdom of God among 'em.</hi> So no doubt there was a <hi>Chriſtian Chur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h</hi> at <hi>Epheſus;</hi> and yet <hi>Timothy</hi> reſiding there, is exhorted to <hi>preach the word, to be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon.</hi> And in the place I firſt alledg'd, the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> was deſirous to preach the Goſpel to thoſe at <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe Faith was already ſo eminent, and ſo publickly known and celebrated. And indeed, tho the Goſpel be in the ſtricteſt ſenſe only news to thoſe that firſt hear it, yet it dos not ceaſe to be good tidings, or a joyful meſſage for being often repeated. So that ſince the Bp. has ſo ill hap in every one of his <hi>Criticiſms,</hi> I wou'd adviſe him to be more ſparing and deliberate in offering 'em to publick view; for his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent dos not ſeem to lye much that way.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>The Scriptures have left it to human prudence to determine, What portion of 'em ſhall be read in our publick Aſsemblys, and in what order and method.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To clear this, We muſt conſider there are two ways of Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures in order to the peoples inſtruction from 'em. As either</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>When ſome conſid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rable portion of 'em is read together. As ſome part of a Book or Epiſtle, a Pſalm, &amp;c.</hi> For the diviſion of the Scriptures into <hi>chapter</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> are but a matter of late Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>When ſeveral paſſages are read out of ſeveral Books, of the Old or New Teſtament, which are parallel to each other, and ſerve to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the ſame Doctrine, or clear and enforce the ſame duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho the phraſe of <hi>Reading the Scriptures</hi> be by common cuſtom appropriated to the former, yet if we will ſpeak ſtrictly, It dos as truly belong to the latter; and 'tis of this latter way of <hi>Reading the Scriptures</hi> for the people's inſtruction that we have the cleareſt warrant from the examples of the Apoſtles, and the accounts given us in the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> of the practice of the <hi>Chriſtian Church.</hi> Nor do thoſe baniſh either of theſe ways of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:134578:43"/> reading (either an entire portion, or ſeveral parallel Texts) that interpoſe an <hi>explicatory</hi> and <hi>applicatory</hi> Paraphraſe between the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts that are read. Nor dos the Bp, that I can find, ſo much as pretend to produce any thing from Scripture againſt the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixing ſuch a paraphraſe in our reading the Scriptures. Now if he conſult all the Sermons of the Apoſtles recorded in the <hi>Acts,</hi> he will find that they did read (or what is the ſame, did recite <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim,</hi> and propoſe to the conſideration of the people) ſeveral paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the word of God, all tending to illuſtrate and prove ſome <hi>truth</hi> or <hi>duty</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion. And their practice here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was conformable to that of our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour,</hi> who employd the firſt Chriſtian Sabbath, I mean the day of his Reſurrection, not in reading an entire portion of Scripture, but in expounding to the two Diſciples all thoſe paſſages in <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to himſelf and his <hi>death, reſurrection and aſcention,</hi> 24 <hi>Luke,</hi> 24 <hi>Luke,</hi> from the 13th. to the 28th. Nor do I find in that account given of the Worſhip of Chriſtian Churches, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 <hi>chap.</hi> any mention made of <hi>Reading the Scriptures,</hi> as a diſtinct thing from <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Interpretation;</hi> So that I know of no one <hi>precept</hi> or <hi>example</hi> in all the New Teſtament relating to the Chriſtian Church for this way of <hi>reading,</hi> unleſs what may be inferr'd from the 4 <hi>Col.</hi> 16. <hi>And when this Epiſtle is read omong you, cauſe that it be read alſo in the Church of the Laodiceans, and that ye likewiſe read the Epiſtle from Laodicea.</hi> But then we muſt not urge the Inference from theſe words too far, for I know of none that think themſelves oblig'd by it to <hi>read a whole Epiſtle</hi> at one time, tho no doubt it was fit the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> ſhou'd ſo read this Epiſtle then, as we ſhou'd be as forward to read a much longer that came newly to us from the ſame inſpired Pen. And yet becauſe reading an entire portion of Scripture was ſo conſtantly practis'd in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and the reaſon of it ſeems in part to extend to us, I do think 'tis very fit that that way of Reading ſhou'd be alſo retain'd in our publick Aſſemblys; tho how long an entire portion ſhall be ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily read, and in what order, muſt be determin'd by Chriſtian prudence according to the general Rules of Scripture.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:134578:44"/>V, <hi>'Tis granted that the Word of God ſhou'd be read with great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity; but there is no particular poſture preſcrib'd in our hearing of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For tho we read, 8 <hi>Neh.</hi> 5. that the people <hi>ſtood at the opening the Book of the Law,</hi> yet that poſture ſeems there to refer to the Bleſſing we read of in the following <hi>verſe.</hi> And tho we ſhou'd grant that the people <hi>ſtood</hi> here when the Law was read, yet they are elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſaid to <hi>ſit.</hi> Thus, 33 <hi>Ezek.</hi> 30, 31. when they came pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly to hear what <hi>was the word that came forth from the Lord,</hi> yet they are deſcrib'd as <hi>ſitting before him as his people.</hi> And thoſe aſſembled in the <hi>Synagogue</hi> on the <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> 13 <hi>Acts,</hi> 14, 15. are repreſented as uſing the ſame poſture, as <hi>ſat down while the Law and Prophets were read.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>For explaining and applying the Scripture by way of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Exhortation, It was a conſtant part of their Lord's-day wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in Chriſtian Aſſemblys in the Apoſtles time.</hi>

               <hi>Doctrine</hi> is mention'd together with <hi>breaking of Bread</hi> and <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> as one branch of their ſtated devotions, 2 <hi>Acts</hi> 42. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 26. Nor do we read of one Chriſtian Aſſumbly that I remember on that day without it. And it appears by the teſtimony of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, that it was conſtantly practis'd in the firſt ages of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity (as the Bp. himſelf grants, <hi>p.</hi> 76) their <hi>Sermons</hi> being uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally an <hi>explication</hi> and practical <hi>emprovement</hi> of that portion of Scripture which had been read. Nor dos what the Bp. ſuggeſts, <hi>p.</hi> 75. render it probable that this was not conſtantly done in Chriſtian Churches. For what he produces from 13 <hi>Acts</hi> 15. concerns the Jewiſh Synagogues, and even the argument drawn from thence is not cogent, for tho there had been conſtant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for <hi>Enlargement,</hi> yet the Rulers of the Synagogue knowing that the Apoſtle and his followers pretended to ſome new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, might ſend that meſſage to 'em. For what he ſaith from 12 <hi>Rom.</hi> 6, 7, <hi>&amp;c. That St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſuppoſes him who Teaches, and him whoſe office it was to exhort, diſtinct from him that ruled and miniſtred. And it dos not appear that every Church was furniſht with all theſe Officers;</hi> I ſhall only anſwer, It dos not appear from this
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:134578:44"/> place, that theſe four things requir'd four diſtinct Officers. We read only of two ordinary Officers in the Chriſtian Church, <hi>viz. Elders,</hi> or <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Deacons;</hi> See 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 1 <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 20 <hi>Acts</hi> 28. To the latter, <hi>miniſtring to the poor</hi> belong'd; To the former, <hi>Teaching, Exhorting</hi> and <hi>Ruling;</hi> and as theſe were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral branches of the ſame Office, ſo probably ſince there were many ſuch <hi>Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Elders</hi> conſtituted in every particular Church, 14 <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 1 <hi>Tit.</hi> 5. Some might have their talents and abilities more ſuited to one part of their work, and others to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and accordingly they might ordinarily divide their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, and each attend what he was qualify'd for. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the Bp. well obſerves, that that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> conjoyns <hi>Doctrine</hi> &amp; <hi>Exhortation</hi> in his charge to <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13. And 'tis probable both are included in the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi>'s Exhortation to <hi>Elders,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I do agree with him that there ſhou'd be ſuch a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of the principal doctrines of the Goſpel as our Catechiſms and Confeſſions of Faith uſually contain; Which form of ſound words ſhou'd be held faſt; Tho that the 6 <hi>Heb.</hi> 1, 2. contains that form mention'd, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. is but doubtful, and 'tis much more doubtful whether that 6 <hi>Heb.</hi> 1, 2. contain'd ſix diſtinct principles or heads of doctrine; Of which, more afterwards.</p>

There are ſome Accuſations ſo groſs and ſhameleſs, that 'tis hard for a man to treat 'em with decency, and to ſuch Accuſers we are often forc'd to apply the <hi>Archangel</hi>'s language, <hi>Ep. Jude, v</hi> 9. But our Author has that peculiar infelicity, that the more noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious untruths he delivers, he is ſtill the more confident in 'em, and nothing will ſerve him, but appealing to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe for the truth of what he ſays, who moſt certainly know it to be falſe. For with what face can the Bp. ſay, <hi>That a man may frequent the D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Spirit as our Sanctifier and Comforter, the neceſſity of his ſupernatural Aids, the different future ſtates of the Righteous and the Wicked, the general Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and final Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are ſeldomer taught in their Pulpits than in thoſe of the <hi>Conformiſts?</hi> Or that the <hi>Diſsenting Miniſters</hi> leſs frequently urge the great duties of Godlineſs, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Sobriety, and a heavenly mind and life upon their Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? Dos he not know that the <hi>Directory</hi> requires that ordinarily
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:134578:46"/> the Subject of the Miniſter's <hi>Sermon</hi> ſhall be ſome Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture holding forth ſome <hi>Principle</hi> or <hi>Head of Religion?</hi> Nay, dos he not know that the peculiar <hi>myſteries</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion are ſo much more frequently inculcated in the Sermons of <hi>Diſsen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> as occaſion'd ſome of 'em to reproach the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> with Preaching little but <hi>morality,</hi> and borrowing their Diſcourſes ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> than from the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Writings, and the <hi>Conformiſts</hi> to reproach them with turning all <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> into <hi>myſteries,</hi> and Preaching <hi>morality</hi> too little? (I do not recite theſe criminations as approving 'em, for I abhor ſuch general and blind cenſures, but as an evidence that matter of fact is in the general opinion of both ſides contrary to the Bp's repreſentation of it). Or dos he think it a good argument to prove that 'tis hardly poſſible for our people to learn the neceſſary Articles of their Faith from our publick Teachings, meerly becauſe we are left to our choice as to the Subject we treat on? Can he find any ſcriptural <hi>Rule</hi> or <hi>Example</hi> preſcribing to ordinary Teachers the exact order in which they ſhou'd explain the myſteries of Chriſtian Religion to the People; and yet was it therefore hardly poſsible for the people in the firſt age to learn 'em all from their publick Teachings? As if ordinary judgment and prudence were not ſufficient to direct eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Miniſter in this part of his duty. And whereas he ſaith, that hardly any one man in his life ever goes thro the neceſſary Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith, or of Practice in his publick Sermons, and appeals to our ſelves herein, I muſt needs tell him, all the Miniſters that I have diſcourſt with, are amaz'd to think what ſhou'd tempt him to aſſert what all our Hearers know to be a groundleſs calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
            <p>And whereas he tells us, <hi>That we have no ſummary of Principles enjoyn'd to be either read or taught in our publick Aſſemblys,</hi> I might here enquire what <hi>precept</hi> or <hi>example</hi> he can produce from <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> requiring our <hi>Reading</hi> or <hi>Teaching</hi> ſuch a <hi>ſummary</hi> in publick, diſtinct from the <hi>H. Scriptures.</hi> Nay, tho we ſhou'd grant him that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> intends ſuch a <hi>ſummary</hi> by the <hi>form of ſound words</hi> mention'd, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. yet how will he certainly prove that it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:134578:46"/> was to be publickly <hi>read</hi> and <hi>taught</hi> from <hi>Timothy</hi>'s being charg'd to <hi>hold it faſt?</hi> The 39 <hi>Articles of Religion</hi> the Bp. no doubt takes to be ſuch a <hi>form of ſound words</hi> that is to be <hi>held faſt,</hi> and yet they do not think it neceſſary to be publickly <hi>read</hi> and <hi>taught,</hi> any farther than the Doctrine of Miniſters ſhou'd be conformed to it. But if he intend hereby to accuſe the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> as careleſs of their peoples being inſtructed in ſuch a <hi>ſummary</hi> of the Principles of Religion, or (as we commonly ſpeak) of their being <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiz'd,</hi> I do not know any Miniſters in the world whom he can leſs juſtly accuſe in this matter. And perhaps the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and thoſe in <hi>Scotland,</hi> do (ſpeaking generally) outſtrip all others that we know of in the Chriſtian world, as to their unwearied diligence in <hi>cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chizing</hi> thoſe under their charge. And indeed the Bp's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations put me on the neceſſity of doing 'em juſtice in this point, by giving the <hi>Reader</hi> ſome account of their general practice. To that purpoſe I muſt premiſe, that they divide all the perſons in their <hi>Pariſhes</hi> grown up to years of diſcretion into <hi>Communicants</hi> and <hi>examinable</hi> perſons. For <hi>Communicants,</hi> they do not only ſtrictly examine them as to their knowledge when firſt admitted to the Lord's Table, but alſo perſonally viſit each of 'em once a year at leaſt, and particularly examin 'em as to their progreſs both in the knowledge and practice of Religion. For <hi>examinable</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they divide their <hi>Pariſhes</hi> into ſo many <hi>diſtricts,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly for every <hi>diſtrict</hi> once a year, they publickly appoint the time and place when they intend to <hi>catechize</hi> 'em, and accordingly go thro the whole of the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> with 'em. Nay, they are ſo punctual and exact herein, that if any have been <hi>abſent,</hi> they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly appoint another day for the <hi>catechizing</hi> 'em. So that there is not one of theſe perſons in their Congregations come to years of age, who is not once every year conſtantly inſtructed in the <hi>principles</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion, and perſonally examin'd about his knowledge of 'em. Now either the Bp. knows this matter of fact, or he dos not. <hi>If he do not,</hi> Why will he pretend to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſo confidently what he is ſo entirely ignorant of? <hi>If he do,</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:134578:47"/> How can he excuſe himſelf in aſſerting, that there is no ſecurity, or hardly poſſibility of the <hi>Diſsenters</hi> learning from the publick Teachings of their Miniſters all the great myſteries of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or neceſſary Articles of their Faith, when thoſe very Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters among whom he reſides, take ſo effectual a method, that there is not one ſoul under their care, but if he learn 'em not, 'tis groſly his own fault, and cannot be imputed to the neglect of his Miniſter. And if the ſubtilty of this charge lye in the word <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Teachings,</hi> I ſhall only add, that theſe <hi>catechizings</hi> of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons contain'd in theſe ſeveral diſtricts are <hi>publick Teachings,</hi> and ſuch days are publickly appointed for 'em, on which the people can beſt convene for that end. And I cou'd wiſh his Lp. cou'd give us as ſatisfactory an account of the diligence of the Conforming Clergy in inſtructing all the particular perſons under their inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and charge. And I may add, that in the Meetings of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> here, and in <hi>England,</hi> 'tis the general practice to catechize publickly on the Lord's-days, and the Catechiſm is uſually gone thro once every Summer. And I am ſure our Catechiſm is a far more comprehenſive ſummary of the <hi>Doctrins</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion than that us'd in the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church.</hi> So little reaſon reaſon has he to accuſe thoſe that rather ſet others a Copy worthy their imitation. And what his Lp ſaith of 'em, is ſo contrary to truth, that if their people be as willing to learn as they are diligent to teach, 'tis ſcarce poſſible that any of 'em ſhou'd be ignorant of the neceſſary Principles of their Faith.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Aſſemblys Catechiſm</hi> he has ſome exceptions againſt it, which I ſhall briefly conſider.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It no ways</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>anſwers the deſign of a form of ſound words, which ſhou'd contain only the firſt and neceſſary Principles of the Oracles of God in ſuch words and method as may make it eaſily apprehended and attain'd by the weak and unlearned, which make up the bulk of the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. How can the Bp. expect any <hi>Reply</hi> to ſo general a <hi>charge.</hi> I rather think the <hi>Aſsemblys</hi> Catechiſm is herein excellently ſuited to the various capacities of <hi>Catechumens.</hi> It has at the end, <hi>the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:134578:47"/> Creed,</hi> the <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> as the <hi>ſummary</hi> of our <hi>Belief, deſires</hi> and <hi>practice.</hi> And in thoſe, I hope his Lp. will grant the firſt and neceſſary principles of the Oracles of God are plainly laid down. And indeed the <hi>Church-Catechiſm</hi> contains little more. But for thoſe whoſe capacity is ſomething more emprov'd, the Queſtions and Anſwers in that Catechiſm do excellently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the three fore-mention'd <hi>ſummarys</hi> of our Religion, and lay down ſuch other Principles as are the moſt important and need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inferences from 'em. And why dos our Author imagin that no <hi>form of ſound words</hi> muſt comprehend more than what is to be firſt taught the loweſt ſort of <hi>Catechumens,</hi> when almoſt all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches do herein differ from him; few of whom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Catechiſms for their people that are not rather longer than the ſhorter one compos'd by the <hi>Aſſembly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas he adds, <hi>Our Catechiſm is full of hard words, ſchool-terms, and abſtruſe notions no wiſe neceſſary to be known, nor poſſible to be underſtood by children or unlearned perſons, for whoſe Edification principally a Catechiſm ought to be deſign'd;</hi> I only add, If he had expected any Anſwer, he ſhou'd have been particular in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation, and not left us to gheſs in the dark what inſtances he grounds it upon.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>He accuſes it of being ſo long and intricate, that no one child in ten gets it by heart, nor one in</hi> 500 <hi>retains it, as he ſaith he has found by experience;</hi> To which I ſhall only anſwer, that as we have little reaſon to believe the Bp. has ſo often tried this matter as to enable him to paſs ſo particular a judgment about it, ſo his experience and ours (who have better opportunity of trying it) do no way agree. For we know there is nothing in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar computation that comes near to truth in matter of fact. And I believe if his Lp. make a more accurate trial, he will find as many of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> children that have got their <hi>Catechiſm</hi> by heart, as of others that have done ſo by the <hi>Church-Catechiſm,</hi> even tho the former be ſo much larger. And if any of 'em forget it again, 'tis their own fault, not their Miniſter's, who more exactly examin 'em in that point, than any others that I know of. But</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:134578:48"/>2. His ſevereſt charge againſt this <hi>Catechiſm</hi> is, <hi>That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing its length, it is imperfect; ſome of the principles of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's Catechiſm being quite left out of it, I mean laying on of hands joyn'd with Baptiſm,</hi> 6 Heb. 2. <hi>A great defect ſure in a Catechiſm to leave out a fundamental of Chriſtianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. Is it not ſtrange that the Bp. ſhou'd have no regard to the reputation of his own Church in ſuch weak cenſures as theſe? Dos he mean that our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> has laid aſide the expreſsion of of <hi>laying on of hands,</hi> or the thing ſignify'd by it. If he mean only the expreſsion, cou'd he not eaſily foreſee that ſuch an objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Aſſemblys Catechiſm</hi> has no weight in it? Nay, that the <hi>Church-Catechiſm</hi> is liable to the ſame objection? I wou'd deſire him to take the pains to read it over, and tell us where he can find <hi>laying on of hands</hi> mention'd in it. If he means the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd by <hi>laying on of hands,</hi> Why dos he not tell us what it is, but leave us to blind conjectures what this fundamental Principle is which he charges our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> as defective for the omiſſion of? Dos he mean ſuch <hi>laying on of hands</hi> on children as our Saviour us'd when he <hi>bleſt</hi> 'em, 19 <hi>Matth.</hi> 13? Or <hi>laying on of hands</hi> on the ſick when they were <hi>heal'd,</hi> 7 <hi>Mark</hi> 32? Or <hi>Impoſition of hands</hi> on ſuch as the Apoſtles <hi>Baptiz'd</hi> in order to the communicating the extraordinary gifts of the H. Spirit to 'em, 8 <hi>Act</hi> 17? Or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of hands</hi> in order to the ſetting perſons apart to ſome ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Office</hi> or <hi>Charge,</hi> 6 <hi>Acts</hi> 6? Or <hi>impoſition of hands</hi> on the <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> 1 <hi>Lev.</hi> 4. 8 <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. 29 <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 23? For Expoſitors mention all theſe various ſenſes of the word in their comments on 6 <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. Now I wou'd entreat him to review 'em, and tell me which of theſe ſorts of <hi>impoſition of hands</hi> is ſpoken of in the <hi>Church-Catechiſm.</hi> (For I hope he dos not miſtake the <hi>Rubrick about Confirmation</hi> for a part of it.) If none of 'em are mention'd in it for the Inſtruction of <hi>Catechumens,</hi> why ſhou'd he charge that as a great defect in our <hi>Catechiſm</hi> which is wanting in their own? But what if I ſhou'd tell him, 'tis highly probable that neither <hi>Baptiſms</hi> nor <hi>Impoſition of hands</hi> are mention'd in that fore-cited <hi>ſummary</hi> of Principles, 6 <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. as <hi>diſtinct Principles</hi> at
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:134578:48"/> all? He knows Expoſitors obſerve that the Original may be read thus, <hi>Not laying again the foundation of Repentance from dead works and Faith in God, being the Doctrine of Baptiſms and Impoſition of hands (i. e.</hi> the <hi>Doctrine</hi> typify'd by thoſe two rites in the Jewiſh Religion, their legal <hi>Waſhings</hi> or <hi>Purifications,</hi> and the <hi>Impoſition of hands on the head of the Sacrifice</hi>). For as thoſe legal <hi>Purifications</hi> were typical of <hi>Repentance from dead words,</hi> ſo that <hi>Impoſition of hands on the head of the Sacrifice</hi> was typical of <hi>Faith in God thro a Mediator and his attoning ſacrifice.</hi> Or we may take both theſe rites as typical of <hi>Faith in God, thro the expiatory and cleanſing ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Mediator's Sacrifice.</hi> And I ſhall ſuggeſt three things to ſtrengthen this Expoſition. Firſt, that this Expoſition is moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the ſcope of the Inſpired Writer, who was about to treat of this <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and its <hi>expiatory vertue,</hi> as the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titype</hi> of the legal <hi>Purifications</hi> and <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> (as appears from the 9th <hi>ch.</hi> of that <hi>Ep</hi>). Secondly, becauſe <hi>Baptiſms</hi> in the plural number is never, that I know of in all the Scriptures, us'd concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Chriſtian Baptiſm,</hi> but is us'd in this very Ep. concerning the <hi>Jewiſh Waſhings</hi> or <hi>Purifications,</hi> 9 <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. Thirdly, becauſe 'tis not eaſily conceivable how any of the other ſorts of <hi>Impoſition of hands</hi> ſhou'd come to be made here by the Inſpired Writer, a <hi>fundamental principle</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion. For why ſhou'd the Doctrine of <hi>External Baptiſm</hi> or that of <hi>Impoſition of hands</hi> in any of the ſenſes fore-mention'd, be any more rank't among <hi>Fundamental Articles,</hi> than the Doctrine of the <hi>Lord's-Supper,</hi> of which there is not the leaſt mention made here? But ſince the Bp. ſeems to inſinuate here as if he took the <hi>Confirmation</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd in the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church</hi> to be one of the <hi>Principles</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, 6 <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. I wou'd very gladly, if he be of that Opinion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what grounds he has for it. For I am prone to ſuſpect that the <hi>Order</hi> of the Church about <hi>Confirmation,</hi> is an <hi>Abuſe</hi> that needs to be <hi>reform'd.</hi> Were there nothing more in it, than a grave Biſhop's <hi>praying over children,</hi> and uſing this common Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh cuſtom as our Saviour did, of <hi>laying his hands</hi> on their heads while he prayd, I ſhou'd not much quarrel with it, tho why the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:134578:49"/> Pariſh-Miniſter's <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Bleſſing</hi> (under whoſe Paſtoral care they are) ſhou'd not be as ſignificant, I know not. But I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand no good reaſon, why the <hi>Biſhop</hi> ſhou'd be order'd to ſay in the <hi>Collect</hi> us'd on this occaſion, <hi>That he lays hands on 'em by the example of the H. Apoſtles, to certify 'em by this ſign, of God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and gracious goodneſs towards 'em.</hi> For I take the Arguments which the learned <hi>Daillé</hi> has produc'd againſt his <hi>Romiſh</hi> Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, in his admirable <hi>Diſcourſe about Confirmation,</hi> to prove, <hi>That the Apoſtles laid hands on the newly-baptiz'd only to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the extraordinary gifts, not the ordinary ſanctifying influences of the H. Spirit,</hi> to be unanſwerable. How come our <hi>Biſhops</hi> then to <hi>lay hands</hi> on children after <hi>their Example,</hi> when they do not pretend to any ſuch power of communicating thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> had? Nay, what divine war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant have they to <hi>certify children by this ſign, of God's favour and gracious goodneſs towards 'em?</hi> What promiſe can they produce of God's annexing his <hi>favour</hi> to this <hi>ſign?</hi> If they can produce ſuch a <hi>promiſe,</hi> here is a <hi>New Sacrament</hi> of divine Inſtitution in the Chriſtian Church beſides <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's-Supper.</hi> If they can produce none, here ſeems to be a new <hi>Human Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> For according to the definition of the Church-Catechiſm, <hi>Here is an outward viſible ſign, viz.</hi> The Impoſition of hands; <hi>'Tis a ſign of ſpiritual grace,</hi> no leſs than <hi>God's favour and gracious goodneſs;</hi> The <hi>Sign</hi> is made a <hi>means of conferring it,</hi> becauſe thoſe that uſe it, profeſs to <hi>do it in imitation of the holy Apoſtles,</hi> who did certainly by their <hi>Impoſition of hands</hi> communicate the holy Spirit; And 'tis expreſly made by the <hi>Collect a pledge to aſsure 'em of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here wants nothing then but <hi>Chriſt's Inſtitution,</hi> which if it be not produc'd, here is in the proper ſenſe of the word, a <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Invention of men</hi> in the worſhip of God. And we ſhall have the greater reaſon to be jealous of it, if our Author advance the doctrine of it into an <hi>Eſſential Article of our Religion.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may hence perceive that 'twas not in vain that the Church Catechiſm puts ſo wary an Anſwer into the childrens
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:134578:49"/> mouths when that Queſtion is propos'd, <hi>How many Sacraments are there? Anſw. Two only as generally neceſſary to Salvation, viz. Baptiſm and the Lord's-Supper.</hi> But if <hi>Confirmation</hi> be a <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of divine Inſtitution</hi> at all, I know not why it ſhou'd not be as neceſſary to Salvation as either of the other; If it be not, Why is it retain'd? I know indeed there is a ſort of <hi>Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> which thoſe excellent Divines Mr. <hi>Hanmer</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> plead for, <hi>i. e.</hi> They wou'd have <hi>adult</hi> perſons oblig'd publickly to own their Conſent to the <hi>Baptiſmal Covenant</hi> in order to their <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> to the <hi>Lord's-Supper,</hi> But then they wou'd have this done at ſuch years when they are capable of profeſſing an underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſerious and credible conſent to it. But this can no way ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the common practice of the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church</hi> in admitting children to it as ſoon as they can ſay the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Lord's-Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Ten Comandments,</hi> tho no ſuch underſtanding conſent to their Baptiſmal Engagements can be expected from 'em. For this is no better than perverting a moſt uſeful practice (and agreeable to the general Rules of Scripture) into an empty Formality, or rather a ſolemn Trifling and Mockery.</p>

This is matter of fact, and undeniable. And in all the Meetings of the North of <hi>Ireland</hi> in a whole year, perhaps there is not ſo much Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture read as in one day in our Church, by the ſtricteſt enquiry I cou'd make, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sure 'tis a ſad thing that a man may go to moſt Meetings many years, and never hear one entire Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter read in 'em.</q>

And upon the beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enquiry I can make, he will find very few Meetings, if any at all, that vary from this practice, What Apology then can he make not only for his charging 'em with <hi>caſting-out the Reading of the Scriptures,</hi> but for his telling us, <hi>that perhaps there is not ſo much Scripture read in all the Meetings in the North of</hi> Ireland <hi>in a year, as in one day in the Eſtabliſht Church.</hi> Let us ſuppoſe there are 40 Meetings in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and let us ſuppoſe in each Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing half a Chapter read every Ld's-day for three quarters of the year; (And this is the leaſt that is really read, for they more commonly read a whole Chapter) yet by this computation there will be near 800 Chapters read in thoſe Meetings in a year; And will his Lordſhip perſuade us that there is as much read in one day in the Church? If he mean that there is as much read in one day in all the <hi>Pariſh-Churches</hi> in the <hi>North,</hi> there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like Truth in his Aſſertion. If he mean there is as much read every day in each <hi>Pariſh-Church</hi> (as his words ſeem to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port) what he aſſerts is ſo ridiculous, that one wou'd think, if he had no regard to truth, yet he ſhou'd have ſome to common ſenſe, in his accuſations. Nay, I muſt add, that I look upon his Lordſhip's charge as ſo unjuſt, that if we take the Scriptures to be read when-ever they are <hi>verbatim</hi> recited to the People, and compute all the parallel paſſages of Scripture that occur in their <hi>Expoſitions,</hi> and in their <hi>Sermons</hi> (in both which the N. C. Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in general, and particularly thoſe in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> never us'd to be ſparing in the uſe of their <hi>Concordances</hi>) I ſee little reaſon to doubt but there is as much of the Scriptures read, or as much of the inſpired word of God propos'd for the Inſtruction of the people in each Meeting, as there is in each Pariſh-Church. And in the former 'tis always read with this advantage, that whatever is read, is expounded too, in order to the peoples being more fully inſtructed in it. And if this be a juſt account of matter of fact, I hope his Lordſhip will think himſelf oblig'd in honour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:134578:51"/> to diſabuſe his Readers by retracting ſo groſs a flander as this, of our <hi>caſting out the reading of the Scriptures, and juſtling the word of God out of our ſolemn Meetings,</hi> ſo that <hi>his voice is ſeldom publickly heard in 'em.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For if there be any difference between us and the Eſtabliſht Church in this point, It lies in this, <hi>Whether the Reading a larger entire Portion without any explication</hi> (or, as he ſpeaks, without <hi>cover</hi> or <hi>gloſs) or a ſhorter entire portion of it, with an explication chiefly drawn from parallel paſsages of Scripture, that give light to that which is read, be more conducive to the Inſtruction and Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People?</hi> And here the Diſſenters are ready to joyn iſſue with him. For as to this debate, we may juſtly appeal to all ſober and unprejudic'd pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſons. 'Tis certain their way of <hi>Reading</hi> the Scriptures without any <hi>Expoſition</hi> of 'em, is far the <hi>eaſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt;</hi> and he need not take any great pains to recommend it to the Clergy, who are not likely to be fond of this <hi>human Invention</hi> of lecturing on 'em. But if the other way of <hi>reading</hi> 'em (<hi>viz.</hi> with a brief expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation) be not more inſtructive and edifying to the People, 'tis becauſe the Scriptures are beſt underſtood by the People with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any help from their Teachers. And if ſo, why did our Saviour appoint any publick <hi>Teachers</hi> in his Church at all? If there be ſuch a <hi>plainneſs in the Scriptures</hi> as needs little explication to ordinary Hearers, If they <hi>apply themſelves better than any man can do</hi> (as his Lp. inſinuates when he ſeems to touch on this debate, <hi>p</hi> 94.) Why ſhou'd ſuch Teachers undertake ſo needleſs a task? Why ſhou'd they ſpoyl the <hi>plainneſs</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of the Scriptures with their uſeleſs endeavors to explain 'em to the underſtandings, and urge 'em on the Conſciences of their people? Nay, if the bare <hi>Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the Scriptures be moſt edifying, meer <hi>Readers</hi> are far prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the beſt <hi>Teachers,</hi> and a good pair of <hi>eyes</hi> and <hi>lungs</hi> will enable the moſt ignorant <hi>Curate</hi> to contribute as much to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Salvation of the People by the exerciſe of thoſe <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Talents,</hi> as the moſt judieious <hi>Divine</hi> can by his laborious en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to <hi>explain</hi> and <hi>apply</hi> the Scripture, and by the exerciſe of thoſe <hi>gifts</hi> which are the product of the Divine Bleſſing on his
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:134578:51"/> unwearied ſtudy of thoſe ſacred Writings. And if his Lp. can perſuade us of the truth of this, we ſhall ſave a great deal of our money that we lay out in buying, and our pains in reading ſuch uſeleſs things as <hi>Commentarys</hi> on the Bible. But ſure when our Proteſtant Divines aſſert the Scriptures to be <hi>plain in all things neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> (as he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 94.) they do not mean ſo <hi>plain,</hi> as to exclude our diligence in comparing one part of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with anothor, or the help of Teachers to direct and aſſiſt us therein. Much leſs do they ſuppoſe their help unneceſſary to our growing in divine knowledge, and going on to perfection in it.</p>
            <p>'Tis indeed true that there are ſome few Meetings (tho perhaps not five in this whole Kingdom) in which there is rarely any entire portion of Scripture read. And yet even theſe the Bp. dos unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charge with baniſhing the <hi>Reading</hi> of the word of God, ſince they retain that moſt uſeful way of <hi>Reading</hi> it, (<hi>viz.</hi> the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many parallel Texts that illuſtrate the ſame Truth or duty) of which we have the moſt frequent Examples in the New-Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. And indeed there are few Sermons of Diſsenters in which there is not as much of the Scriputres recited to the People, as if put together, wou'd make up two or three Chapters. But I confeſs I take the omiſſion of this other way of Reading <hi>(viz. an entire por<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nay, when the ſhortneſs of the days in the Winter-quarter leaves no room for <hi>Expoſition,</hi> I cou'd wiſh the <hi>reading an entire portion</hi> were ſtill more generally continued, as 'tis done in ſome Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations; In that to which I belong, both are continued through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole year. The Bp. may indeed juſtly charge us with falling ſhort of reading ſo much as the <hi>Directory</hi> recommends, but he will find it hard to prove that we fall ſhort of what any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God to the Chriſtian Church obliges us to. And I do impartially think there are no Chriſtian Aſſemblys whatever, wherein more of the <hi>voice of God in his Word is heard by the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <pb n="96" facs="tcp:134578:52"/>
            <p>Since then I have rectify'd his Lp's miſtake in matter of fact, I hope he may eaſily ſee how little we are concern'd in the reaſons he brings to condemn what he ſo falſly accuſes us of, <hi>viz.</hi> our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral <hi>caſting out the reading of the Scriptures,</hi> or in the Anſwers he gives to ſuch <hi>Excuſes</hi> as he pretends are alledg'd to juſtify it.</p>
            <p>He tells us indeed, that he has found ſuch pretences to juſtify it, but he was wiſer than to produce his Authors for 'em. As if the publick were concern'd in all the follys he can pick up in his converſation with ignorant people. And no wonder when he meets with ſo weak Opponents, that he can eaſily triumph over 'em, or rather that he can anſwer the Arguments he frames to himſelf. For as I have ſhew'd him, the generality of the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters need no apology for <hi>not reading the Scripture;</hi> whatever others may do for laying aſide the Expoſition of what is read, to whoſe conſideration I wou'd recommend the excellent words of St. <hi>Austin</hi> on 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> where ſpeaking of the Scripture, he ſaith, <hi>Quare legitur ſi ſil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

While you thus juſtle out the word of God out of your ſolemn Meeting to make room for your own Sermons, I beſeech you to conſider whether this be not laying aſide the Commandments of God for men's Inventions, unleſs you'll call your Sermons (as ſome Quakers are ſaid to do) as much the word of God as the Bible.</q>

            <p>Anſw.

May we not as wiſely tell our Author that he has <hi>juſt led out this Text</hi> by paraphraſing it, eſpecially when he has done it ſo untowardly, and ſo little agreeably to the deſign of our Bleſſed Saviour? Nay how comes he here to call Sermons the <hi>Inventions of Men?</hi> Dos he think that God has not as expreſsly enjoyn'd <hi>Teaching</hi> and <hi>Exhortation,</hi> as <hi>Reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> to Chriſtian Paſtors? Nay of the two more expreſsly, there being far more numerous and plain paſſages for the former then for the latter, as diſtinguiſht from the former? How comes he then to make that a <hi>human Invention</hi> which he owns has ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Example to warrant it, <hi>p. 75.</hi> nay for which I have produc't him plain precepts too? Nay how comes he to aſſign us ſo wonderful a Reaſon, why we muſt own Sermons to be men's <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> viz. <hi>that otherwiſe we muſt call e'm (as ſome Quakers are ſaid to do) as much the word of God as the Bible?</hi> Dos he indeed eſpouſe that ſottiſh Opinion of the <hi>Quakers</hi> who account every thing in the Worſhip of God a <hi>human Invention</hi> that is perform'd in the exerciſe of our own rational Faculties, and requires our Study and Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the compoſure of it? If he do, I am afraid he muſt abandon the <hi>Reading of the Scriptures</hi> as an <hi>human Invention</hi> too, becauſe that requires the uſe of our <hi>Eyes,</hi> and ſome ſmall uſe of our <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> too to read right? Nay he muſt on the ſame account call all the <hi>Collects</hi> in the Liturgy <hi>human Inventions</hi> (as the <hi>Quakers</hi> do) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he cannot pretend 'em to be as much divinely inſpir'd as the <hi>Prayers</hi> recorded in the Bible.

            <p>Anſw. Either he means they are more ſo, in proportion to thoſe that are members of the <hi>Eſtabliſh't Church,</hi> or he dos not, If not to what purpoſe dos he upbraid the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> with it. If he dos, I wou'd deſire him to conſult his credit a little better then by obtrud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo notorious untruths upon the world. 'Tis impoſſible to make exact Computations of this kind; But I doubt not, that if he takes a thouſand Families of each Communion, he will find that for <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Conforming Laity</hi> that reads the Scripture dayly in their Families there are <hi>ten</hi> or <hi>more</hi> of the <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> I am credibly inform'd by ſuch as live in the North, that moſt Families of Diſſenters read the Scriptures dayly, and eſpecially on the Lord's day, both before they come to the publick worſhip and after; And 'tis partly on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that the Miniſters lay down their Expoſitory Lectures in the depth of Winter. Whereas ſince comparatively ſo few Conforming Families have the Scriptures read in 'em, there may be perhaps the greater neceſſity for the reading a larger entire portion of 'em in the Pariſh Churches. I may ſay the ſame as to the other branch of the Accuſation, For the account given before of the care of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to <hi>catechize</hi> every particular perſon in their Pariſhes renders it abſolutely incredible that their People ſhould be greater ſtrangers to the <hi>firſt Principles of Chriſtianity</hi> then others on whom no ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular pains are beſtow'd.</p>
            <p>The Bp. tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 95. <q>Reading a Verſe or two, and truſting to the Miniſter's Application, without the Peopl's being acquainted with the whole Body of Scripture, dos put Chriſtians too much in the power of their Teachers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is the very Artifice whereby the Romiſh Prieſts keep their People in Ignorance; And your Teachers uſing the ſame method ſeems too like a deſign on their Hearers, and tempts the World to ſuſpect that they are afraid of the naked ſimplicity of the Scriptures, ſince they dare not truſt the People with hearing 'em publickly read, except they add their own gloſſes on 'em.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. Has his Lp. any juſt ground for this invidious Compariſon? Do the Romiſh <hi>Prieſts</hi> when they Preach put Bibles into their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's hands? Do they read it to 'em in their Mother Tongue? Do
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:134578:55"/> they urge their people to bring Bibles with them, and like the Noble <hi>Beraeans,</hi> to examin all they deliver, and not to take things on truſt from their Teachers, without trying what they hear by that infallible Teſt? And yet he knows this is the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> practice, to whoſe Meetings moſt of their people bring Bibles, whereas few compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively bring 'em to the publick Churches, unleſs it be that ſmall part of 'em which the Common-Prayer-Book contains. Nay, do not thoſe rather imitate the Romiſh Prieſts, who tho they <hi>lock</hi> not up the Scriptures in an <hi>unknown Tongue,</hi> yet never <hi>open</hi> 'em when they read 'em by a judicious <hi>Expoſition?</hi> Or dos he think bare <hi>read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the Scriptures, without ever comparing 'em, will beſt acquaint the People with the body of 'em? Or dos he think the People are in greateſt danger of being <hi>ſeduc't,</hi> when the Scriptures are <hi>explain'd</hi> as well as <hi>read</hi> to 'em, and that they are then likeſt to take up the right ſenſe of 'em when they have no Interpreter to guide 'em? Were the Apoſtles afraid of the <hi>naked ſimplicity</hi> of the Scriptures becauſe they took ſo much pains to add their own <hi>gloſſes</hi> on 'em? Or dos he think that meer <hi>Readers</hi> have done more to recover Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity to it's primitive ſimplicity and purity, and to reclaim the world from the deluſions of <hi>Popery</hi> then the moſt laborious <hi>Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors?</hi> Why then do we not throw away all our <hi>Commentaries</hi> on the Bible? Why dare not his Lp. in this Diſcourſe truſt us with the <hi>naked ſimplicity</hi> of the Scriptures he quotes in it without adding his own <hi>gloſſes</hi> on 'em?

            <p>For the <hi>5th.</hi> Excuſe, <hi>p.</hi> 96. viz. <hi>That the Word of God, that dead Letter, is a dull formal thing, without ſpirit or life, where it is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, &amp;c.</hi> I wonder what <hi>Diſſenter</hi> ſuggeſted it to his Lordſhip; For 'tis a very <hi>dull pretence,</hi> and yet I do not ſee that the main thing he inſiſts on in his Anſwer dos vary much from the nature of the Objection. For not to inſiſt on his ſtill calling that a <hi>human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi> which is undoubtedly of <hi>Divine Appointment,</hi> (and by his own Confeſſion has the warrant of Scriptural Example, <hi>p. 75,</hi>) If there be any thing to the purpoſe againſt the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> practice in his 3d. and 4th. <hi>Conſideration,</hi> it muſt be founded on this ſuppoſition,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:134578:56"/> 
               <hi>That 'tis a great character of a Spiritual Man to love to hear the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures read without any Expoſition or Application, but of a Carnal Man, to delight more in Scripture read and expounded too, then in the Scripture barely read. For ſo he applies that noted paſſage of the Apoſtle</hi> Paul, 1 Cor. 2.13. And thence <hi>He reproaches the Diſſenters as (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their pretences to a more then ordinary ſpiritualneſs and reformation) little advanc't above the natural man that neither receives nor reliſhes the things of God, at leaſt not as they ought.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. If any thing cou'd put us out of conceit with Expoſitions of the Scripture, it wou'd be ſuch ſcurvy and abuſive ones as this, which his Lp. here offers. And I do not believe there is any <hi>Diſſenter</hi> but wou'd delight in the peruſal of thoſe excellent <hi>words</hi> of the Apoſtle, while he nauſeates ſuch an inſipid <hi>gloſs</hi> on 'em. For muſt it not ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue a ſtrange Confuſion in a man's Notions of things to ſuppoſe thoſe things ſo <hi>oppoſite</hi> and <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> that ſo admirably <hi>accord</hi> together? Dos the Biſhop think the ſtyle of the Scriptures is as familiar to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Readers now, as it was to thoſe to whom the ſeveral parts of it were firſt immediately directed, or that there is no difficulty in the ordinary parts of it that renders a brief Interpretation highly uſeful to the Church? And do thoſe <hi>love</hi> or <hi>reliſh</hi> the Word of God leſs then others, who are not contented with the bare <hi>reading</hi> of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſiring all the help their Teachers can give 'em for their right underſtanding and applying it? Was it an Argument of a <hi>carnal</hi> mind in the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Candace's Treaſurer</hi> that he was not ſatisfied with reading God's Word by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> without deſiring <hi>Philip</hi> to expound it, 8. <hi>Acts</hi> 27? Is it ſo <hi>carnal</hi> a practice in Miniſters to read <hi>Commentators</hi> on the Bible, or in the People to deſire to enjoy this fruit of their ſtudies and labours? Is it a <hi>carnal</hi> temper to be moſt <hi>affected</hi> with the Scriptures when we moſt clearly <hi>diſcern</hi> the true ſenſe of 'em; but on the contrary, a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> diſpoſition to <hi>delight</hi> in 'em moſt when we <hi>underſtand</hi> 'em leaſt? Or rather, dos not ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe as this look too like a ſhrewd deſign to gratifie the <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>lazy</hi> humour of the Clergy, by excuſing 'em from the pains they ſhould take in <hi>ſtudying</hi> the Scriptures in order to the edifying their People by a judicious <hi>interpretation</hi> of 'em? As if our Author wou'd
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:134578:56"/> have e'm all transform'd into ſuch as the 49th. <hi>Canon</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> refers to, who, <hi>tho Benefic't yet being unlicens't to Preach, are not to take on them to Expound in their own Cure or elſewhere any Scripture or matter of Doctrine,</hi> and have no higher priviledge allow'd 'em, then <hi>that they ſtudy to read aptly and plainly</hi> (without <hi>glozing</hi> or <hi>adding</hi>) the <hi>Homilies already ſet forth,</hi> &amp;c. (And by the way, I perceive the Compilers of thoſe Canons were great Strangers to our Author's Notion of <hi>Preaching</hi>)</p>
            <p>But after he has examin'd the pretences he feigns the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to make, (for 'tis evident they never brought any for not <hi>Reading</hi> the Scriptures) he ventures to give us what he himſelf takes to be the true Reaſon of their ſuppoſed Neglect of it, which he draws from 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. of which he gives us an admirable Interpretation. The Apoſtles words are, <hi>For the time will come when they will not endure ſound Doctrine, but after their own Luſts ſhall heap up to themſelves Teachers having itching Ears.</hi> 
               <q>Now an itching Ear (ſaith the Bp.) is one that loves novelty and variety. Becauſe therefore our Church gives the People little that is new in her prayers or reading the Scriptures, but retains a Form of ſound words in the one and the plain word of God in the other: Hence it is that ſome People cannot endure our ſervice, but heap up to themſelves Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that inſtead of Prayers and Praiſes of God's immediate Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will gratify 'em every meeting with a new Prayer without troubling 'em with ſuch Prayers and Sermons as they think old which are incomparably better; Only the itching Ears of the People, as the Apoſtle foretold are pleaſed with the novelty and variety of the one, and diſguſt the repetition of the other, as the <hi>Israelites</hi> did that of Angels Food, 78 <hi>Pſ.</hi> 25.21 <hi>Num. 5.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. If we be ſo fond of <hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Variety</hi> as the Bp. ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, he has been very ſtudious to gratify our humour in this new <hi>Paraphraſe,</hi> of which I dare ſay no Expoſitor before him ever dream'd. For whereas the Apoſtle is plainly ſpeaking of ſuch as <hi>cou'd not endure ſound Doctrine,</hi> and therefore ſought out <hi>Teachers</hi> that wou'd gratify 'em with ſome new <hi>Doctrines,</hi> more grateful to their Luſts or Fancys, and entertain their <hi>itching Ears</hi> (as the Apoſtle explains himſelf in the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:134578:57"/> next verſe:) <hi>with Fables inſtead of Truth.</hi> The Bp. dos with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found judgment apply it to thoſe that deſire to have the Scriptures clearly <hi>explain'd</hi> to their Underſtandings, and impartially <hi>applied</hi> to their Conſciences. As if the Apoſtle had here quarrell'd with the People for deſiring <hi>Sermons,</hi> when he had in the very verſe before urg'd <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>preach the word, To be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, To reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long ſuffering and Doctrine.</hi> And if we ſhou'd grant the Bp. for once (tho as I have ſhew'd him before there is no reaſon for it) that the Apoſtle by <hi>preaching the word</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>Reading</hi> it, yet according to himſelf, <hi>Rebuking, reproving</hi> and <hi>exhorting with all long ſuffering and doctrine</hi> muſt imply an <hi>Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Application</hi> of what was <hi>read.</hi> So that the Bp. has unhappily <hi>expounded</hi> and <hi>applied</hi> this paſſage of the Apoſtle in direct oppoſition to the very <hi>ſcope</hi> of it, which was to urg <hi>Timothy</hi> to conſtant <hi>preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in our and the common ſence of the word, as the moſt effectuall means to cure people of that <hi>itching</hi> deſire after ſuch new <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Fables</hi> as wou'd pleaſe their wanton fancys or vitious Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Whereas the Bp. imagines that the Apoſtle here condems the People's fondneſs for ſuch <hi>Sermons</hi> as the very fault they were to be cur'd of, and ſo ſtrangely miſtakes the <hi>Remedy</hi> for the <hi>Diſeaſe.</hi> I confeſs how much ſoever our <hi>Ears</hi> may <hi>itch</hi> after <hi>Novelty</hi> and <hi>Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety,</hi> yet he cou'd not reaſonably expect they wou'd be <hi>charm'd</hi> with <hi>contradictions,</hi> which inſtead of <hi>tickling</hi> 'em <hi>grate</hi> upon 'em. And truly if our Author gives us no better <hi>Expoſition</hi> and <hi>Application</hi> of Scripture then this, Wee'l be much rather ſatisfy'd he ſhou'd only <hi>read</hi> it to us, For then there wou'd be leſs danger of miſunderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it. But I wonder why his Lp. ſhou'd tell us of <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Praiſes</hi> of <hi>God's appointment?</hi> Dos he not know the <hi>Collects</hi> of the <hi>Liturgy</hi> are as much of human Compoſure as our <hi>free prayers?</hi> Why then ſhou'd they be any more compar'd to <hi>Angels Food</hi> then ours, which are rather more agreeable to ſcriptural <hi>precept</hi> and <hi>Pattern?</hi> Nay, if the Scriptures read be <hi>Sermons</hi> of <hi>Gods Appointment,</hi> they are not the leſs ſo, but the more for being <hi>explain'd</hi> and <hi>applied,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from this very direction of the Apoſtle to <hi>Timothy, to preach the word to be inſtant in ſeaſon, &amp;c. to rebuke, &amp;c.</hi>

            <pb n="103" facs="tcp:134578:57"/>
            <p>I ſhall conclude what relates to our practiſe with the concluding words of this chapter of the Bp's.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But as <hi>Aaron</hi> to pleaſe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> made the Golden Calf, ſo ſome Miniſters tho contary to their own principles have chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God's Inſtitution to pleaſe their People, and left out the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant regular Reading God's word becauſe their People grew weary of it. But let all men judg who behave themſelves moſt like the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, We who keep to the reading God's word according to his own Inſtitution, whether the People will hear or forbear, or they that comply with 'em and lay aſide God's command to oblige and pleaſe 'em.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. I have already conſider'd the injuſtice of this charge, And only add, That thoſe more <hi>fully comply with God's command,</hi> who <hi>read</hi> and <hi>expound</hi> then thoſe that only <hi>read.</hi> And I am ſure as the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> practiſe herein coſts 'em more labour, ſo, if their People be not more edify'd by it, It muſt be their own fault. With what juſtice then or indeed with what ſenſe dos his Lp. compare the <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> practiſe herein to <hi>Aarons making a Golden Calf to pleaſe the People?</hi> Are indeed Lectures and Sermons ſuch dangerous <hi>Idols,</hi> Or is Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures <hi>expounded</hi> when <hi>read</hi> ſo pernicious a piece of <hi>Idolatry?</hi> Is not the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of Scripture as truly a divine Ordinance as the <hi>Reading</hi> of it? And will any man that conſiders what he ſaith ſet the <hi>one</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>other?</hi> Or rather wou'd not the confining Miniſters to the <hi>Reading</hi> the Scriptures only, tend to debaſe 'em into ſuch a ſort of <hi>Prieſts</hi> as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> made <hi>of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the People</hi> when he ſet up the Worſhip of the <hi>Golden Calves.</hi> 1 Kings 12.31. I mean ſuch <hi>Prieſts</hi> as need little other furniture for their publick Miniſtrations then their <hi>book</hi> and their <hi>eyes,</hi> and are under no obligation to <hi>ſtudy</hi> the Scriptures becauſe they are under no neceſſity of <hi>interpreting</hi> 'em to the People? And what a ſort of Clergy are to be found in <hi>Ruſſia, Muſcovy,</hi> and other parts of the Chriſtian World, where they are turn'd into meer <hi>Readers,</hi> we have ſo ſad ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts from <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> that if his Lp. intend to turn his Clergy into ſuch, by thus diſcouraging Sermons as an <hi>human Invention,</hi> I ſhou'd not blame the <hi>diſſenting</hi> miniſters for being loth to come under his conduct and regulation.</p>
            <pb n="104" facs="tcp:134578:58"/>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this Chapter with obſerving in reference to the practiſe of the <hi>Eſtabliſh't Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That I ſuppoſe the Bp. will not pretend any Warrant from <hi>precept</hi> or <hi>Example</hi> in the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> for the reading ſuch un-inſpired Books as thoſe of the <hi>Apocrypha</hi> together with the Canonical Writings of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi> in the time of publick Worſhip: And therefore I hope he'l cenſure this himſelf for one of his <hi>human Inventions.</hi> Eſpecially ſince himſelf owns there is a tenth part of the old Teſtament left out of the Churches order for the Reading it, ſure to exclude that and introduce in the ſtead of it, the ſtory of <hi>Bell</hi> and the <hi>Dragon, Tobit</hi> and his <hi>Dog, &amp;c.</hi> looks very like the preferring meer human Compoſures (ſome of which contain fooliſh and incredible Relations) before that part of God's living Oracles. Not to mention how little care is taken to diſtinguiſh 'em when read from the Canonical Scriptures, and prevent the common people's miſtaking 'em for ſuch. But however his Lp's prudence is commendable in taking no notice of this matter, becauſe thoſe <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations</hi> are beſt paſt over in ſilence, againſt which there is no <hi>defence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That the common practiſe of the <hi>Conforming</hi> Clergy in the Countrey, of having only one <hi>Sermon</hi> on the Lord's day, nay in the far greateſt number of <hi>Pariſhes</hi> of having no publick Worſhip at all one part of the day, is a defect that needs ſome effectual Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſeem to have better reaſon to blame the <hi>Conforming</hi> Clergy for caſting out the <hi>Expoſition</hi> of the Scripture when read (as that Exerciſe is now diſtinguiſh't from <hi>Sermons</hi>) then the Biſhop to reproach them for not <hi>reading</hi> the Scripture.</p>

            <head>Remarks on the Chapter concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Bodily Worſhip. And here Firſt, As to the <hi>Directions</hi> of the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> concerning it.</head>
            <p n="1">1. I Do readily agree with the Bp, <hi>That Bodily Worſhip is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Scriptures.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not that I ſuppoſe it (as his Lp. dos) to be a diſtinct <hi>part</hi> of Worſhip from <hi>Prayer, Praiſe, &amp;c.</hi> but only a ſutable <hi>Adjunct</hi> of it, (of which more afterwards).</p>
            <p n="2">2. I do agree with him alſo, that the moſt common <hi>poſtures</hi> of <hi>Bodily Worſhip</hi> mention'd in Scripture, as us'd in <hi>Thankſgivings</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> were <hi>proſtration, kneeling</hi> or <hi>ſtanding.</hi> As to this laſt of <hi>ſtanding,</hi> the Bp. takes notice of it as us'd in <hi>Thankſgivings,</hi> and <hi>p.</hi> 143. owns it to have been a <hi>Scripture-poſture</hi> in <hi>Prayer</hi> too. But ſince he gives no inſtances of it, as us'd in <hi>Prayer,</hi> I ſhall take leave to ſubjoyn a few, and the rather becauſe this is the <hi>poſture</hi> the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> moſt generally uſe in this duty when publickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd.</p>
            <p>Of this <hi>poſture</hi> in <hi>Prayer,</hi> the beſt Expoſitors underſtand <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's ſtanding before the Lord,</hi> 18 <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. Thus the <hi>Levites ſtood</hi> up in that <hi>Confeſſion</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> they made, 9 <hi>Neh.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So to <hi>cry to God,</hi> and <hi>ſtand up,</hi> are us'd as ſynonimous expreſſions, 30 <hi>Job</hi> 20. And 15 <hi>Jer.</hi> 1. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Samuel's ſtanding before God</hi> is put for <hi>praying to him.</hi> So alſo, 18 <hi>Jer.</hi> 20. And accordingly it was (as <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerves, on 6 <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.) the moſt univerſally-receiv'd cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom among the Jews to pray <hi>ſtanding.</hi> Thus, 18 <hi>Luke,</hi> 10, 11.
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:134578:59"/> 
               <hi>Two men went up to the Temple to pray,</hi> and <hi>ſtanding</hi> is the religious poſture us'd by each of 'em. So 11 <hi>Mark.</hi> 25. When ye <hi>ſtand</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, forgive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hence <hi>Prayers</hi> were not only call'd <hi>Stations</hi> by the <hi>Jews</hi> (among whom it was a celebrated ſaying, <hi>That without ſtations the world cou'd not ſubſiſt</hi>) but alſo by ſome of the moſt ancient <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Writers. For the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> not only imitated the <hi>Jews</hi> in this religious poſture, but becauſe they accounted their <hi>Lord's-days</hi> their joyful <hi>Feſtivals,</hi> they forbad kneeling on 'em, and requir'd <hi>ſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. As <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> are ſuch Acts of Worſhip where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we immediately addreſs our ſelves to God, ſo <hi>hearing</hi> ſeems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be a <hi>mediate</hi> act of Worſhip, and therefore the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of devotion ſeems not neceſſary therein, as in our <hi>direct</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to him. And hence we read of <hi>ſitting,</hi> as the poſture us'd in this part of Divine Worſhip, 33 <hi>Ezek. v.</hi> 31 — And this is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd both in their Congregations and ours.</p>
            <p>Being thus eaſily agreed as to the <hi>Directions</hi> of Scripture, It remains that we conſider</p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>Application of 'em,</hi> In which the Bp. undertakes to repreſent the <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Diſſenters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. As to our <hi>Principles,</hi> He ſaith, <hi>You do not allow Bodily Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be any part of God's Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. If he mean that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> do not ſuppoſe that <hi>God is to be worſhipt with our body as well as ſpirit,</hi> and that we are not oblig'd to uſe ſuch external poſtures and behaviour as may moſt fitly expreſs our inward reverence of God and ſubjection to him, nothing can be more groundleſs than to affirm this concerning 'em. But if his Lp mean, that they do not allow bodily poſtures of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be in the ſame ſenſe a <hi>part of religious worſhip,</hi> as <hi>Prayer, Praiſe, Hearing, &amp;c.</hi> are, It is true; And they think he has made a very unaccurate enumeration of the parts of Worſhip, when he has omitted <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> which is one undoubted <hi>part</hi> of it, and made thoſe devout poſtures a <hi>part,</hi> which are more properly an <hi>Adjunct</hi> of it. For they are not a diſtinct <hi>Duty</hi> from <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praiſe, &amp;c.</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the <hi>manner</hi> of performing 'em, which ſhou'd be fit to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:134578:59"/> our profound veneration for that glorious Majeſty whom we adore. And in vain dos he refer us to what he had ſaid, <hi>p.</hi> 105, 106. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the proof of theſe devout bodily poſtures being in this ſenſe a <hi>part</hi> of Worſhip. For we find nothing more there, then that God requires theſe external marks of our inward Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, when we offer up our <hi>Prayers</hi> or <hi>Thanksgivings,</hi> and has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden our paying 'em to any <hi>graven Image,</hi> that accordingly it was the practice of holy men, both in the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> to offer theſe parts of worſhip to God in ſuch devout poſtures; And that the Scriptures frequently call theſe external poſtures of devotion by the name of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> on the account of their being the outward expreſſions, or the viſible marks and ſigns of it. All which we rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily grant; But if he had ſaid any thing to the purpoſe, he ſhou'd have prov'd, that meer <hi>bowing the knee,</hi> or <hi>proſtration, &amp;c.</hi> when there was no other part of worſhip offer'd, neither <hi>vocal</hi> nor <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,</hi> is yet made in Scripture a <hi>part of Worſhip;</hi> which as he has not yet done, ſo I preſume he will not in haſt do it. He dos indeed tell us, <hi>p.</hi> 110. that <hi>bodily worſhip is the moſt proper external Act of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration, that Praying, Praiſing, &amp;c. are not in Scripture termed Worſhip, and that theſe are not immediate direct Worſhip properly ſo call'd, becauſe they do not, as bending or bowing the body, directly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify the ſubjection of our minds to God, in which inward Worſhip properly conſiſts,</hi> and accordingly he tells us, <hi>the words us'd for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the Old and New Teſtament ſignify properly and originally ſome bodily Action.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. That thoſe bodily actions, which are external marks of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence towards God, and ſubjection to him, are call'd in Scripture <hi>Worſhip,</hi> has been already granted; But the reaſon why they are call'd <hi>Worſhip</hi> in general, rather than <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praiſe, &amp;c.</hi> is not becauſe <hi>theſe latter are not immediate direct Worſhip properly ſo call'd,</hi> but becauſe theſe bodily actions are the external expreſſions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious reverence and homage common to all theſe ſeveral parts of direct and immediate Worſhip. For there is a more direct ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of our ſubjection to God in our <hi>prayers,</hi> when we expreſly declare therein our humiliation for our ſins, implore the pardon
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:134578:60"/> of 'em, acknowledge the rightful Authority of God over us, and renew our vows of Obedience to him, than can be ſuppos'd in any external <hi>poſtures</hi> whatſoever. The ſignification of our homage by <hi>words</hi> being more diſtinct, clear, and full, than by <hi>geſtures.</hi> I might ſay the ſame of thoſe <hi>praiſes,</hi> one great part whereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in celebrating the ſovereign authority and dominion of God, as well as the perfections of his nature. So that theſe dutys do more directly expreſs the devotion of our minds, tho poſtures of bodily reverence muſt be annext, becauſe God muſt be glorify'd with our bodys as well as ſpirits</p>
            <p>But he tells us, <hi>The Directory not only leaves out, but excludes bodily Worſhip, by requiring all to take their ſeats, or places, without Adoration, or bowing themſelves towards one place or other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this the Bp. ſeverely decrys, as a <hi>Rule directly oppoſite to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reaſon, as well as to the Commands of God, and the examples of his Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. If the <hi>Biſhop</hi> had duly conſider'd the true occaſion of this Caution in the <hi>Directory,</hi> he wou'd not have put us under a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of reviving the memory of thoſe faults that ſeem'd bury'd with their <hi>Authors,</hi> by ſtraining thoſe expreſſions of the <hi>Directory</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the true intent of 'em. For 'tis well known this <hi>Caution</hi> was levelled againſt the manifold <hi>bowings</hi> and <hi>cringings</hi> which <hi>AB Laud</hi> had endeavour'd to introduce into the Church; who upon the vain conceit of ſome peculiar preſence of Chriſt at the <hi>Altar,</hi> zealouſly propagated the cuſtom of <hi>bowing</hi> towards it; And he having a great influence on the diſpoſal of Church-preferments, on the account of his eminent ſtation, and his great Intereſt at Court, All the aſpiring Clergy were ready to ſtrive who ſhou'd outdo each other in that ſort of <hi>bowing,</hi> which was then the ſureſt way to <hi>riſe.</hi> The <hi>Parliament</hi> was greatly offended with theſe and the like <hi>Innovations,</hi> and eſpecially at the rigor wherewith he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to impoſe 'em on the Inferior Clergy. Now the <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Aſsembly</hi> (compos'd almoſt entirely of ſuch as were <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts</hi>) being call'd to reform ſuch <hi>Abuſes,</hi> do in order to the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual baniſhing theſe <hi>Innovations,</hi> give this <hi>Rule,</hi> by which they
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:134578:60"/> intend no more, than that no ſuch <hi>external Adoration</hi> or <hi>bowing</hi> ſhou'd be us'd by the people as they entred into the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſuppos'd ſuch <hi>external Adoration</hi> ſhou'd only be us'd when ſome <hi>part</hi> of publick worſhip was perform'd. But that they did by no means intend to forbid ſuch <hi>external Adoration</hi> when any <hi>part</hi> of publick worſhip was offer'd, that requir'd ſuch marks of our religious Reverence and Homage, is hence evident, <hi>viz.</hi> from their requiring ſuch as come in after publick Worſhip is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, <hi>reverently to compoſe themſelves to joyn with the Aſſembly in that Ordinance of God that is then in hand,</hi> which can import no leſs than the putting themſelves into a <hi>bodily posture</hi> moſt ſutable to that Ordinance, and expreſſive of due veneration towards God in it. 'Tis true indeed, as to the particular <hi>poſture,</hi> they leave the people to that liberty the Scripture has done, which tho it recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ſeveral, yet dos not confine us to any one to the excluſion of the reſt. So that his Lp. has palpably miſrepreſented this Rule of the <hi>Directory</hi> (on that occaſion too needful and juſtifiable) that he might have ſome pretence to find fault with it. For as I have here explain'd it to him, he may eaſily ſee, 'tis neither <hi>contrary to reaſon nor Scripture,</hi> but only to a ſuperſtitious cuſtom, of <hi>A. B. Laud's Invention,</hi> or at leaſt to one authoriz'd and impos'd by him.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Since then the Bp. has no juſt quarrel with the <hi>Principles,</hi> let's conſider what he has to ſay againſt the <hi>practice</hi> of Diſſenters. And here he tells us,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>At your Thanksgivings and Praiſes you neither bow nor ſtand up.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. If he mean this of our <hi>ſinging of Pſalms,</hi> He knows our poſture is the ſame herein with that us'd in the <hi>Pariſh Churches,</hi> and liable to no other objections, than theirs. If he intends it of thoſe <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> we offer up together with our <hi>Prayers,</hi> what he here aſſerts, if he ſpeak of the <hi>Diſsenters</hi> in general, is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly untrue, and contrary to plain matter of fact, as I ſhall have occaſion to obſerve farther in his charge that refers to our <hi>Prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:134578:61"/>2. <hi>He charges us with caſting out of our Worſhip the Confeſsions of Faith themſelves, which he tells us are a material part of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, for which he cites,</hi> 10 Rom. 9, 10. <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt believe in thine heart that God has rais'd him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſav'd, p.</hi> 129.</p>
            <p>Anſw. Why dos his Lp. think the bare citation of that Text a ſufficient proof of what he here infers from it, when he knows well enough, that theſe words are by the ſtream of all judicious Commentators underſtood concerning the <hi>external profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion</hi> in general, (which we eſpecially make in our attendance on all the publick Inſtitutions of our Lord) but by none that I can meet with beſides himſelf concerning the <hi>repetition of a ſummary of the Chriſtian Faith</hi> in our publick Aſſemblys. If they were to be underſtood of the latter, 'tis but a very ſhort <hi>ſummary</hi> we are here requir'd to repeat, and ſuch a one as we never perform any part of Divine Worſhip without repeating much more. But for the repeating that particular <hi>ſummary</hi> commonly call'd the <hi>Apoſtle's Creed,</hi> or any other later one of human compoſure, there's not one word in this place, nor indeed any <hi>precept</hi> or <hi>example</hi> in Scripture. So that the <hi>Rehearſal of ſuch a Confeſsion of Faith,</hi> is, according to the Bp's notion, a meer <hi>human Invention.</hi> And yet I am far from condemning the practice of the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church</hi> in rehearſing the <hi>Apoſtle's Creed;</hi> and have known it retain'd in ſome Meetings of <hi>Diſſenters.</hi> Only I ſee no reaſon why thoſe that uſe it, ſhou'd cenſure thoſe that do not, when there is no clear war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for it. And the Bp. ſhou'd, of all men, be leaſt forward to do it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>He accuſes the Diſſenters of ſitting generally at their publick Prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. If he ſpeak here of the generality of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and in this part of <hi>Ireland,</hi> what he ſaith is notoriouſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true. I know few or none that do it, except ſuch as pretend <hi>bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infirmity,</hi> in which caſe I ſuppoſe the Bp. himſelf will allow it as much as to a ſick man to pray in his bed. If he deſign this charge only in refernce to the <hi>Diſsenters</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:134578:61"/> where alone there ſeems to be any ground given for it, I ſhall firſt repreſent to him what account the Miniſters there give of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and then add my own thoughts in reference to it. Now they not only affirm, that the better ſort of their Hearers do ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally <hi>ſtand,</hi> but that they frequently in their Diſcourſes to 'em recommend that, or <hi>kneeling,</hi> as the fitteſt poſture, where bodily imfirmity dos not hinder it. But they dare not be too peremptory in their cenſuring thoſe that pretend ſuch infirmity, ſince many of their people travel 3 or 4 miles to their Meetings, and may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be reaſonably ſuppos'd to be incapable of long <hi>ſtanding</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out danger of diſcompoſing their minds for the Worſhip of God. And for <hi>kneeling,</hi> the places where they meet are uſually too much crouded to admit of their uſing that poſture. And there are ſome of 'em think their <hi>ſitting</hi> in ſuch caſes warranted by Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pattern, particularly the inſtance of <hi>David's ſitting before the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7, 8. As to this account, I ſhall only briefly ſubjoyn, that I am truly ſorry there are ſo many that by <hi>ſitting</hi> in publick <hi>Prayer,</hi> have given ſome occaſion for this cenſure of the Bp's. For tho I doubt not, real infirmity is a juſt excuſe for not <hi>ſtanding;</hi> yet 'tis too probable, that too many under that notion too far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult their eaſe; for <hi>ſtanding</hi> is generally us'd by <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lund,</hi> even in thoſe places where many of the people go as far to their Meetings. And for that paſſage alledg'd, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7, 8. I do truly think there is ſome weight in what the Bp. has offer'd, to render it probable that the word ſhou'd be tranſlated, <hi>David ſtayed,</hi> or <hi>abode</hi> and certainly ſo many plainer and more numerous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of <hi>kneeling</hi> or <hi>ſtanding</hi> are to be rather imitated by us than this doubtful one of <hi>ſitting.</hi> So that for ſuch as uſe this ſlothful poſture without real neceſſity, to endulge their eaſe, I cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe 'em from <hi>irreverence</hi> in it. And hope they will not perſiſt in a practice ſo offenſive to their brethren elſewhere, and diſlik't by their Paſtors. And methinks they ſhou'd be ſenſible of the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of it, if they conſider, that they themſelves univerſally <hi>kneel</hi> or <hi>ſtand</hi> in <hi>Cloſet</hi> and <hi>Family-prayer,</hi> and 'tis unaccountable why they ſhou'd not as univerſally do it in <hi>publick prayer,</hi> where their
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:134578:62"/> bodily ſtrength will permit. But then I muſt add, as to his Lordſhip, that as he has no reaſon to reproach the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in general with this unſeemly practice, ſo, ſince the Miniſters in the <hi>North</hi> have ſo faithfully declar'd to their people their diſlike of it, they can no more juſtly be upbraided with it, than the <hi>Conforming Clergy</hi> with all that <hi>toying</hi> and <hi>trifling,</hi> and that more <hi>open irreverence</hi> that is too common in many <hi>Pariſh-Churches,</hi> and much more in the <hi>Cathedrals.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. His next Charge is, <hi>At the Sacrament you ſit, not only whilſt you receive, but at the Thanksgiving and Bleſſing before. And this poſture</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>the Directory impoſes on the Communicants, the contrary to ſcripture, in reſpect of that part which concerns the Prayer and Thanksgiving, and without any command, or ſo much as example from Scripture, in reſpect of the ſitting at the time of receiving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſ. That the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> generally <hi>ſit</hi> at the <hi>thanksgiving</hi> or <hi>bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> before <hi>Receiving</hi> (or at the <hi>thanksgiving</hi> after it) is again no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly contrary to matter of fact. If this be practis'd by ſome in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> they are <hi>ſingular</hi> in it, nor ſhall I undertake to excuſe 'em in it. For tho they alledge for it not only the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the multitude's <hi>ſitting</hi> at a common meal when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour <hi>gave thanks,</hi> 14 <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. but that there's no evidence of the Apoſtles diſcontinuing their <hi>Table-geſture,</hi> when Chriſt paſt from the Celebration of the <hi>Paſsover</hi> to the Celebration of his <hi>holy Supper</hi> (For the Text ſaith, <hi>As they were eating, Jeſus took the bread, and bleſt it, &amp;c.</hi> without any mention of a change of their poſture); yet becauſe this is but a doubtful matter, I think it far ſafer to uſe the poſtures of Reverence more generally recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to us in our <hi>Thanksgivings</hi> and <hi>Prayers</hi> by the Scripture, than to venture to omit them on ſo uncertain a ground.</p>
            <p>But I wonder why the Bp. ſhou'd ſo poſitively aſſert that the <hi>Directory</hi> impoſes on <hi>Communicants</hi> this poſture of <hi>ſitting</hi> at the <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> before <hi>Receiving.</hi> For I can ſee no ground for it from their own words, which I perceive his Lp. was too
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:134578:62"/> wiſe to quote, and I ſhall therefore cite for him, and leave the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to every indifferent Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>After this Exhortation, Warning and Invitation, The Table being before decently cover'd, and ſo conveniently plac't that the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants may orderly ſit about it, or at it, The Miniſter is to begin the Action with ſanctifying and bleſsing the elements of Bread and Wine ſet before him; The Bread in comely and convenient Veſſels, &amp;c.</hi> Now 'tis plain, that theſe words about ordering the Table come in as a <hi>parentheſis,</hi> and can import no more than that the <hi>Table</hi> muſt be ſo <hi>plac't,</hi> that the Communicants may <hi>ſit</hi> at or about it; but that they muſt actually <hi>ſit</hi> during the <hi>Bleſsing,</hi> or <hi>Thanksgiving,</hi> is no way <hi>affirm'd,</hi> much leſs <hi>impos'd;</hi> and I am ſure the quite contrary is generally <hi>practis'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for <hi>ſitting</hi> during the time of <hi>Receiving</hi> the elements, that indeed is <hi>ſuppos'd,</hi> tho not <hi>enjoyn'd</hi> by the <hi>Dir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>I hope his Lp. dos not think our practice herein <hi>unlawful,</hi> ſince he declares, <hi>p.</hi> 118. <hi>'Tis not his intention to aſſert that the Scriptures require kneeling at the Lord's Supper, p.</hi> 118. If then the debate be, whether our poſture, or theirs, comes nearer to the <hi>practice</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and is more ſutable to the nature of the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> it ſelf, I think the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> will have the advantage. And ſince his Lp. has ſtated the controverſy thus, I ſhall carefully examine what he has here offer'd in favour of their practice, as preferable to ours.</p>
            <p>He tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 118, 119. <q>That the Altar was of old the Lord's-Table, from whence his Attendants were fed, from 1 <hi>Mal.</hi> 7. That on this account the Iſraelites came to the Altar, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipt before it, as being God's Table, on which the ſacrifice was preſented as his meat, of which they were permitted to partake. From 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.12, 13. and in 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.54. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.22. That the Communion-Table is call'd the Lord's-Table, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. That the Iſraelites partaking of the Altar, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd as an example for our partaking of the Lord's Table, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:134578:63"/> 10.16, 18. That in 22 <hi>Pſ.</hi> 29. there is an alluſion to this reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious eating with bodily worſhip, That we muſt receive the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> in remembrance of Chriſt's death, whom we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to worſhip, 45 <hi>Pſ. v.</hi> 11. See <hi>p.</hi> 118, 119, and 120.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. His Lp. has ſo ill hap in his <hi>Criticiſms,</hi> that he has dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted us here to one of the ſtrongeſt arguments that I know of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt himſelf. And to make this good, I muſt ſet this account of the <hi>Jewiſh Sacrifices</hi> in a clearer light, which he has treated ſo confuſedly.</p>
            <p>The Learned Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> in his excellent <hi>Treatiſe on the Lord's-Supper as a Feaſt upon a Sacrifice,</hi> divides the <hi>Jewiſh ſacrifices</hi> into three ſorts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such as were wholly offer'd up to God, and burnt on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and theſe were call'd <hi>Burnt-Offerings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Such wherein beſides ſomething offer'd to God on the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, the Prieſts had alſo a part of, and theſe he ſubdivides into the <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Treſpaſs-Offering.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Such wherein, beſides ſomething offer'd to God, and a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion beſtow'd on the Prieſts, the Owners themſelves had a ſhare, and theſe were call'd <hi>Peace-Offerings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in all <hi>Sacrifices</hi> there was a <hi>Feaſt</hi> upon 'em. For the firſt ſort of <hi>ſacrifices, viz. Burnt-offerings</hi> had always <hi>Peace-offerings</hi> annext. In the 2d ſort, tho the Owners did not eat of it them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as not being perfectly reconcil'd, becauſe of ſome legal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, yet the Preiſts did eat of it as their proxys. But in <hi>Peace-offerings,</hi> the Owners are ſuppos'd fully reconcil'd, and were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to eat of the Sacrifice themſelves, as a <hi>foederal</hi> rite of amity and peace between God and them; For God entertain'd 'em as his Gueſts at his Table, and feaſted 'em with his proviſions, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtom of thoſe Oriental Nations of confirming Covenants by eating and drinking together. Now Chriſt's <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:134578:63"/> himſelf a ſacrifice on the Croſs, was moſt directly typify'd by the <hi>Burnt-offering,</hi> and the <hi>Lord's-Supper</hi> is a <hi>myſtical Feaſt</hi> upon the memorials of that <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> in alluſion to theſe religious <hi>Feaſts</hi> upon <hi>Sacrifices</hi> under the Law of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence it plainly follows, that if the practice of the <hi>Jews</hi> in reference to their <hi>Feaſts</hi> upon the legal <hi>Sacrifices</hi> be the fitteſt pattern for ours in our <hi>Feaſt</hi> on the memorials of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Chriſt in the <hi>Lord's-Supper,</hi> (as the Bp. dos with very good reaſon aſſert; when from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10, 16. he tells us, <hi>That the Iſraelites par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of the Altar, is propos'd as an example of our partaking of the Lord's-Table, p.</hi> 119.) then we muſt uſe the ſame poſture in our receiving the <hi>Lord's-Supper,</hi> which they us'd in thoſe Religious Feaſts upon <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> of which the <hi>Lord's-Supper</hi> is the Antitype. If then the Jews celebrated thoſe <hi>Feaſts</hi> in a <hi>Table-geſture,</hi> we ſhou'd uſe the ſame <hi>geſture</hi> in our celebration of the <hi>Lords-ſupper.</hi> The Bp. wou'd indeed perſuade us that the Jews did not, becauſe we read of acts of external Worſhip paid to God at the <hi>offering</hi> up of <hi>ſacrifices.</hi> But 'tis plain this argument has no force in it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he cou'd prove they continu'd in that <hi>worſhipping poſture</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of their <hi>eating</hi> or <hi>feaſting</hi> on the things that had been offer'd. But of this he has not brought us the leaſt ſhadow of proof, as he may ſee, if he review his own diſcourſe on this head. Nay, we do in our celebration of the Lord's-Supper firſt <hi>offer</hi> up acts of Worſhip to God (I mean ſolemn thankſgivings and prayers, in which we celebrate his infinite mercy, in giving his Son to dye, as the great propitiation for our ſins, and by Faith as it were preſent that ſacrifice to the Father, and implore his pardon in vertue of it) before we <hi>ſit</hi> down to <hi>feaſt</hi> upon the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of Chriſt's <hi>ſacrifice.</hi> And tho I might here content my ſelf with ſhewing the invalidity of his argument, yet for once to do a work of ſupererogation, I ſhall prove that the Jews did ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate theſe religious <hi>Feasts</hi> upon ſacrifices, not in a <hi>worſhipping-poſture,</hi> but in a <hi>Table-geſture,</hi> not <hi>kneeling, &amp;c.</hi> but <hi>ſitting.</hi>

Of which <hi>rites</hi> we have this plain account, 32 <hi>Exod.</hi> 5, 6. <hi>And when</hi> Aaron <hi>ſaw it (i. e.</hi> the golden Calf, concerning which they ſaid, <hi>Theſe are thy Gods, O Iſrael, that brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, v.</hi> 4.) <hi>he built an Altar before it, and made proclamation, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, To morrow is a Feaſt to the Lord, or to Jehovah.</hi> And it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>And they roſe up early in the morning and offer'd Burnt-offerings, and brought Peace offerings, and the people ſat down to eat and to drink, and roſe up to play.</hi> Where their <hi>ſitting down to eat and drink</hi> was their celebrating this religious <hi>Feaſt</hi> upon the <hi>ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> the <hi>Peace-offerings</hi> being the <hi>proviſions</hi> they fed on. And accordingly when the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> has occaſion to mention this Inſtance of their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> he recites no more than their <hi>ſiting down to eat and drink, &amp;c.</hi> that being a ſufficient evidence of their joyning in the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> on which this was the Religious <hi>Feaſt.</hi> Of ſuch a <hi>feaſt</hi> upon a <hi>ſacrifice</hi> we have a remarkable inſtance given us, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.12, 13. compar'd with the 22 <hi>v. v.</hi> 12, 13. And they anſwer'd 'em and ſaid, <hi>He is, behold, he is before you, make haſt now, for he came to day to the City, for there is a Sacrifice of the people to day in the high-place. Aſſoon as ye come into the City ye ſhall ſtraitway find him, before he go up to the high-place to eat, for the people will not eat till he come, becauſe he dos bleſs the Sacrifice, and afterwards they eat that be bidden; and v.</hi> 22. we read that <hi>Samuel</hi> took <hi>Saul</hi> and his <hi>Servant</hi> and brought 'em into a <hi>Parlour,</hi> and made 'em <hi>ſit</hi> in the chiefeſt place among them that were <hi>bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> which were about 30 perſons. So that <hi>ſitting</hi> was evidently their poſture in this <hi>Religious Feaſt</hi> upon the Sacrifice. Such a <hi>religious Feaſt</hi> was that mention'd, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>ſitting</hi> was again their poſture in the celebration of it. See 57 <hi>Iſ.</hi> 7 23 <hi>Ezek.</hi> 41. in both which places <hi>ſitting</hi> was the accuſtom'd rite in all thoſe <hi>Feaſts</hi> upon Sacrifices among other Nations as well as the Jews. So, 2 <hi>Amos</hi> 8. And of ſuch <hi>Feaſts</hi> on Sacrifices, ſee more 34 <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. 18 <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 106 <hi>Pſ.</hi> 28.</p>
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:134578:64"/>
            <p>And from hence we may not only infer (according to the Bp's own argument) that <hi>ſitting</hi> at this myſtical <hi>Feaſt</hi> on the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of Chriſt's Sacrifice is hereby warranted as <hi>lawful,</hi> but that 'tis moſt <hi>agreeable</hi> to the nature of the <hi>Inſtitution</hi> it ſelf, as the <hi>Lord's-ſupper</hi> is, <hi>Epulum ex oblatis.</hi> Nay this poſture ſeems here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by recommended to us, as moſt fit to ſignify our partaking of the precious vertue and fruits of the <hi>ſacrifice</hi> of Chriſt, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the bleſſed God puts upon us when he admits us to <hi>ſit</hi> down as <hi>Gueſts</hi> at his holy Table, in token of our being <hi>receiv'd into a ſtate of amity and peace with him.</hi> And we are not (as the Biſhop groundleſly ſuppoſes, <hi>p.</hi> 120.) requir'd to offer immediate Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or to the <hi>Father</hi> in the act of <hi>Receiving</hi> at all. We are indeed then requir'd to <hi>eat and drink in remembrance of our bleſſed Saviour;</hi> but this rather argues that <hi>meditation</hi> is then our proper buſineſs, and not <hi>prayer</hi> or <hi>praiſe;</hi> any farther than ſome ejaculatory <hi>deſires</hi> or <hi>thanksgivings</hi> may be intermixt in our <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</hi> But for ſolemn <hi>Worſhip</hi> we have proper occaſion for it, both before and after this myſtical <hi>Feaſt,</hi> and in that we do uſe a <hi>worſhipping</hi> poſture. And as none that know our <hi>principles</hi> can queſtion our paying divine honour to Jeſus Chriſt as the <hi>Incarnate Word,</hi> or <hi>God manifeſted in the fleſh,</hi> ſo none can reaſonably imagin our celebrating this Feaſt upon his ſacrifice in the <hi>poſture</hi> moſt ſutable to ſuch <hi>Religious Feaſts,</hi> to be a denial of his <hi>Divinity;</hi> And therefore we are little concern'd in the order of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches of <hi>Poland,</hi> in oppoſition to the <hi>Socinians;</hi> If they thought this rite of <hi>ſitting</hi> to be of <hi>ill ſignification</hi> and <hi>original,</hi> it appears from what has been ſaid that they were miſtaken; but as <hi>kneeling</hi> is of a far more ſuſpicious <hi>original,</hi> ſo we are ſure it has been abus'd to the vileſt <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For his firſt Anſwer, <hi>That we are not requir'd, nor is it convenient to imitate all that Chriſt did, And that the Apoſtle Paul mentions not this poſture as any part of what he had receiv'd from Chriſt concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Sacrament,</hi> I need only Reply, That 'tis certainly <hi>ſafeſt</hi> to imitate the example of the Apoſtles in ſuch a <hi>poſture</hi> as is evidently moſt agreeable to the nature of the Inſtitution. And tho the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:134578:65"/> 
               <hi>Paul</hi> dos not expreſly mention it as receiv'd from Chriſt, yet he ſufficiently intimates ſo much to us, when in the foregoing Chapter he compares this <hi>Feast</hi> on Chriſt's ſacrifice with the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Feaſts</hi> on the Jewiſh ones, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16, 17, 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which this <hi>poſture</hi> was ſo univerſally receiv'd, that there was no need of expreſſing it.</p>
            <p>For his ſecond Anſwer, <hi>That he has prov'd religious eating was accompany'd with bodily Worſhip, and therefore if it were granted that we were oblig'd to Receive this Sacrament in a Table poſture, from the example of our Saviour, yet it wou'd not follow that we ſhould not receive it kneeling, &amp;c. p.</hi> 123, 124.</p>
            <p>Repl. It appears ſufficiently from what has been already al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, that the Bp. confounds the <hi>Worſhip</hi> paid when the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was <hi>offer'd</hi> with the <hi>poſture</hi> us'd when they came to <hi>feaſt</hi> upon it. And I have already produc't him undeniable evidence, that they celebrated their Religious <hi>Feaſts</hi> upon Sacrifices <hi>ſitting,</hi> or in the ſame poſture as their other meals, and never <hi>kneeling,</hi> or in a <hi>worſhipping</hi> poſture; And conſequently it will follow, that if we ſhou'd receive it in a Table-geſture, we muſt receive it ſitting, and not kneeling.</p>
            <p>For his third Anſwer, <hi>That our Saviour was not at a common Supper when he inſtituted this Sacrament, but at the Paſsover, which was a ſacramental eating, and had a peculiar poſture preſcrib'd for it,</hi> 12 Exod. 11. <hi>and tho ſome think (but without warrant from Scripture) that the Jews did not obſerve this, yet 'tis own'd they obſerv'd another, which differ'd from the common poſture of eating, and was accounted Religious; however 'tis ſpoken that our Saviour perform'd this eating with ſeveral religious Ceremonies that were not in the firſt Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And he here inſtances in the Cup mention'd,</hi> 22 Luke 17. <hi>and therefore</hi> (he adds) <hi>if we wou'd imitate Chriſt, we ought to eat the Lord's-Supper in a way peculiar to it ſelf, and different from our common meals.</hi>

            <p>Repl. That our Saviour was celebrating the <hi>Paſsover</hi> when he inſtituted his <hi>Supper</hi> is undoubted, and that the <hi>Paſſover</hi> was no common <hi>Supper,</hi> is alſo true. For (as Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> has in the diſcourſe I mention'd before evidently prov'd) it was a <hi>Religious Feaſt</hi> upon a Sacrifice; But all this plainly concludes againſt his Lp, becauſe in every one of the three Evangeliſts, <hi>Mathew, Mark</hi> &amp; <hi>Luke,</hi> there is expreſs mention of their <hi>ſitting down</hi> when they celebrated this <hi>Religious Feaſt.</hi> 26 <hi>Matt.</hi> 20. 14 <hi>Mark</hi> 18. 22 <hi>Luke</hi> 14. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>. For the <hi>poſture</hi> preſcrib'd, 12 <hi>Exod.</hi> 11. there is no expreſs mention either of their <hi>ſitting</hi> or <hi>ſtanding,</hi> and I do not ſee any clear ground thoſe few Expoſitors go upon, that conclude the Iſraelites were then to eat the Paſſover <hi>ſtanding,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>they were to have their ſhoes on;</hi> And even thoſe Expoſitors ſuppoſe this poſture of <hi>ſtanding</hi> to have been only us'd at that time, to ſignifie their haſt in fleeing from <hi>Egypt</hi> to be ſo great, that they had not time to eat otherwiſe, but to have been diſus'd after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and the common <hi>poſture</hi> of other <hi>Religious Feaſts</hi> upon Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices <hi>reſum'd</hi> in the celebration of this, <hi>viz. ſitting.</hi> And whereas he tell us, <hi>That 'tis own'd the Jews obſerv'd a poſture in the Paſſover different from the common poſture of eating, and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Religious,</hi> I muſt add, that his Lp. is ſtill unhappy in uſing arguments that make againſt himſelf. I perceive he was ſo pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as not to tell us wherein this <hi>poſture</hi> us'd in eating the <hi>Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi> differ'd from that us'd in their common <hi>eating.</hi> For all that I can find concerning it in the beſt Expoſitors, is only this. All a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree that they did eat the <hi>Paſſover ſitting,</hi> but whereas in <hi>ſitting at Table,</hi> in their common meals, they ſometimes <hi>ſat</hi> with their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dys more <hi>erect</hi> and <hi>ſtraight,</hi> and ſometimes in a more <hi>eaſie</hi> poſture, <hi>leaning</hi> on one ſide, <hi>Grotius, Baxtorf,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> tell us, the Jews did uſually in their <hi>eating</hi> the <hi>Paſsover</hi> rather chooſe this more <hi>eaſy</hi> poſture, and (as the laſt adds) to <hi>ſignifie the more fully their freedom from that ſervitude to which their Anceſtors were ſubjected in Egypt.</hi> So that of the two, this <hi>poſture</hi> had leſs of external re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, than that ſometimes us'd in their common eating, and not more; For it was alſo us'd in their common eating, when they
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:134578:66"/> kept ſtate, and endulg'd moſt their own <hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>pleaſure.</hi> So that if the Bp. can hence draw any argument againſt us, 'tis that our <hi>poſture</hi> of <hi>ſitting upright</hi> has rather too <hi>much</hi> of reverence in it then too <hi>little.</hi> For the <hi>Cup</hi> mention'd 22 <hi>Luke</hi> 17. I know not what it can ſignifie to his purpoſe, whether we ſuppoſe with <hi>Grotius,</hi> that 'twas uſual to conclude the <hi>Paſſover</hi> with drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round, or with others, admit of a <hi>Tranſpoſition of the words.</hi> 'Tis evident our <hi>Saviour</hi> obſerv'd the common <hi>poſture</hi> of <hi>Religious Feaſts, viz. ſitting,</hi> which poſture they us'd alſo in their <hi>common meals,</hi> only in their religious <hi>ones</hi> they always us'd (as <hi>Grotius</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>ſeſſione ſolitâ molliori et honoratiori,</hi> the more ſoft and honourable way of ſitting at meat.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But his 4th. and full Anſwer is, That this argument drawn from the practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles goes on a falſe ſuppoſition that our Saviour inſtituted this Sacrament in the common poſture of eating, which no wiſe appears in Scripture, neither can it be inferr'd from any thing ſaid or intimated by the Evangeliſts, or St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but rather the contrary.</q> And to render the contrary more probable, he alledges, <hi>that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and his diſciples muſt be ſuppos'd to be in a worſhiping poſture when he gave thanks, and bleſſed the bread, and therefore that 'tis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that he roſe to bleſs and diſtribute the holy Sacrament, as he did to waſh his Diſciples feet,</hi> 13 John 4. <hi>tho there be no mention made in the three other Evangeliſts of his riſing to do the former, any more than of his riſing to do the latter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Repl. This is, I confeſs, a bold ſtroke, to call that ſo perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily a <hi>falſe ſuppoſition,</hi> which us'd to be allow'd us by thoſe whoſe practice herein differs from ours, as moſt probable at leaſt. But 'tis no unuſual thing for ſome perſons to ſupply the defect of an argument with an air of aſſurance in propoſing it, And that the Bp's argument here has no force in it. I hope to convince him, if he will examin this matter without prejudice. I have ſhewn him before, that all the Evangeliſts agree that they <hi>ſat</hi>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:134578:66"/> in eating the <hi>Paſſover.</hi> He himſelf owns there is no mention made of their changing their poſture when Chriſt inſtituted this <hi>Sacrament.</hi> All the ſtrength of his argument then lyes on the probability of his <hi>bleſsing</hi> the elements in another <hi>poſture,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently <hi>diſtributing</hi> 'em ſo. Now ſince the <hi>Lord's-Supper</hi> was an Antitype of the Jewiſh Religious <hi>feaſts</hi> upon <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> If it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that that there were <hi>ſolemn Thanksgivings</hi> us'd in thoſe <hi>Jewiſh Feaſts,</hi> and yet notwithſtanding thoſe that ate of 'em <hi>ſat</hi> while they ate, then this ſolemn <hi>Bleſsing</hi> or <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> us'd by Chriſt, gives us no ground to conclude that his Apoſtles did not <hi>ſit</hi> in their celebrating this myſtical <hi>Feaſt</hi> on his Sacrifice, but we have juſt reaſon to conclude the contrary; Now all Writers do agree, that in the <hi>Paſſover-Feaſt</hi> there was ſolemn <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> us'd, and yet all grant that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did eat it <hi>ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</hi> And the ſame may be obſerv'd in other <hi>Religious Feaſts</hi> upon Sacrifices, in that mention'd, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.13. we read expreſly of the Sacrifice being firſt <hi>bleſt</hi> by <hi>Samuel,</hi> and yet we read as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly of their <hi>ſitting</hi> down when they came to <hi>feaſt</hi> upon it. So that the Bp's argument has no weight in it, ſince if applied to that <hi>rite</hi> in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion that's parallel to this in the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> it concludes falſe, and againſt plain matter of fact.</p>
            <p>For his laſt Anſwer, <q>That the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſeverely reproves the <hi>Corinthians</hi> for their irreverence in receiving this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and threatens 'em with damnation for not diſcerning the Lord's-body, that is, for receiving it as their common food, without diſtinguiſhing between 'em by a reverend and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Receiving it. And that 'tis but a due diſtinction between it and our common food, to approach to the Lord's-Table with as much reverence as the <hi>Jews</hi> did to their Altar, at which they never ſat down.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Repl. What that <hi>Irreverence</hi> was which the Apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, he tells us, <hi>That every one took before others his own Supper, and one was hungry, and another drunk,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.21, 22.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:134578:67"/> And this indeed was very groſs <hi>irreverence,</hi> and ſuch as ſhew'd they did not duly conſider the nature and deſign of this Inſtitution, as it was a common <hi>feaſt</hi> upon Chriſt's Sacrifice, wherin they were to commemorate his death, and ſpiritually partake of his <hi>body</hi> and <hi>blood, i. e.</hi> of all the precious fruits of his death and Sacrifice. But he dos by no means charge 'em with <hi>irreverence</hi> for <hi>receiving</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> in the ſame poſture they did their <hi>common food,</hi> tho the relation here given of their practice renders it highly probable they did receive it ſo. His Reproof either relates to the inward exerciſe of their minds, that they did not approach that ordinance with that knowledg of, and Faith in a crucified Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, or with thoſe devout affections towards him, which became thoſe that receiv'd ſuch memorials of his body and blood; Or to their external deportment, that their manner of eating was <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſs'd, diſorderly, uncharitable,</hi> and <hi>intemperate,</hi> but not one word about their <hi>not eating in a poſture of Worſhip.</hi> The ſolemn <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings</hi> that precede and ſucceed our <hi>Receiving,</hi> as well as the <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of what we eat and drink, and its <hi>conſecration</hi> to this holy <hi>uſe</hi> are ſufficient to <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> this <hi>religious Feaſt</hi> from our <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon meals.</hi> And tho the <hi>Jews</hi> might <hi>kneel</hi> at their <hi>Altar</hi> when with the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> they offer'd up their <hi>Prayers,</hi> yet I hope he is by this time convinc't they were far from <hi>kneeling</hi> at their <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Feaſts,</hi> ſince they rather us'd the moſt eaſie way of <hi>ſitting</hi> in 'em.</p>
            <p>If then it appear that <hi>ſitting</hi> was the poſture us'd by the <hi>diſciples</hi> of Chriſt when he adminiſtred this <hi>ſacrament,</hi> If this poſture be moſt agreeable to the nature of the <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> as 'tis a <hi>Feaſt</hi> on the Sacrifice of Chriſt, If the poſture ſeem to carry ſomething in it moſt fit to ſignify the honour God admits us to in vertue of that Sacrifice, <hi>(viz. to be treated by him as his reconciled chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and friends, by being Gueſts at his Table),</hi> Then for any man <hi>to cenſure this poſture as irreverent</hi> (as the Biſhop ſeems to do, <hi>p.</hi> 144.) is little better than to reproach the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> of Chriſt, and their bleſſed Maſter to; and to refuſe this poſture on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:134578:67"/> of <hi>humility,</hi> is to refuſe an endearing mark of God's peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar favour and condeſcention to us; And tho I am ſo charitable notwithſtanding all this, that I dare not poſitively condemn <hi>kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> as <hi>unlawful,</hi> yet how the Bp. will defend it from the ſtroke of his own <hi>Principles,</hi> I cannot tell. For if this be the true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the matter, <hi>kneeling</hi> is a way of celebrating this part of divine Worſhip, which is neither <hi>expreſly commanded in Scripture, nor warranted by any examples there,</hi> nay ſet up to the excluſion of that way which we have plain <hi>example</hi> for, and which is moſt ſutable to the nature of the Inſtitution; let him then try how he will defend the lawfulneſs of it without contradicting himſelf.</p>
            <p>And thus much for the poſture us'd in the celebration of the <hi>Lord's-ſupper.</hi> But before I come to conſider that Inſtitution it ſelf, I muſt add a few Remarks on ſome remaining paſſages in his 3d. Section of this Chapter about <hi>Bodily Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His 5th Charge is, <hi>Too many of your Perſuaſion condemn us who conform to God's Word in theſe particulars, as guilty of Superſtition, and endeavour to render our Conformity ridiculous, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. If he mean that many of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> condemn and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule them for uſing the foremention'd ſcriptural poſtures of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, I cannot imagin what ground he has for what he aſſerts. I have converſt with 'em much more than his Lordſhip, and I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cou'd hear any ſuch thing from 'em. I confeſs many <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> may condemn ſuch practices among 'em as <hi>bowing towards the Eaſt,</hi> (or as the <hi>Laudians towards the Altar), bowing at the Name of Jeſus</hi> rather than that of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or the name of the <hi>Father,</hi> or of the <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> or the name of <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Jehovah,</hi> (as if there were ſome peculiar reverence due to thoſe five <hi>Letters</hi>). The <hi>Reading in the Cathedrals one part of their Service in the body of the place, and the other at the Altar,</hi> when there's no Communion to be celebrated, <hi>the ſtanding up</hi> at the <hi>Reading one</hi> part of the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:134578:68"/> Scriptures more than <hi>another,</hi> when <hi>all</hi> have the ſame ſtamp of Divine Authority; And the Biſhop himſelf has put a very good argument into their mouths againſt 'em; For theſe are <hi>ways of Worſhip</hi> that have neither ſcriptural <hi>precept</hi> or <hi>pattern,</hi> and therefore according to his <hi>Principle</hi> muſt be ſuppos'd to be <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Inventions diſpleaſing to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To theſe particular Accuſations he adds this general one,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In ſhort, I entreat you to conſider that you have not one viſible act of Adoration among you in your Aſſemblys, except we reckon in this number that your men uncover their heads at Prayer, and yet even this is not requir'd by your Directory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. If he ſpeak of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in general, Is it not ſtrange he ſhou'd ſo confidently out-face the Truth in matters of fact; when 'tis ſo notorious, That <hi>ſtanding,</hi> which is a <hi>viſible</hi> and a <hi>ſcriptural</hi> poſture of Adoration is ſo generally us'd by <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in all their <hi>Thankſgivings</hi> and <hi>Prayers?</hi> If ſome in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> are too negligent herein, 'tis the fault of thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, and no more juſtly chargeable on the body of <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,</hi> than the far groſſer irreverence of too many of her Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers is chargeable on the Eſtabliſht Church. For the <hi>Directory,</hi> It dos in general require <hi>external Reverence,</hi> but leaves the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular expreſſions and marks of it, as the Scripture has done to the people's liberty; And accordingly, as ſome that have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience for it uſe <hi>kneeling,</hi> ſo the generality uſe <hi>ſtanding,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are few of our Meetings, but either the ſtraitneſs of the Seats, or the number of thoſe that meet, renders <hi>kneeling</hi> leſs practicable to the main part of the Congregation. And <hi>ſtanding</hi> is as undoubtedly a ſcriptural poſture of Devotion as <hi>kneeling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus clear'd matters of fact, I muſt add, That for the <hi>pretences</hi> he here produces for the neglect of <hi>Bodily Worſhip,</hi> 'tis evident the Body of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are no way concern'd in 'em.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:134578:68"/> For I cou'd never yet meet with one of 'em that ever pretended that <hi>bodily Worſhip</hi> might be neglected. For even thoſe that <hi>ſit</hi> at Prayer (and weakly alledg the ſore-cited example of <hi>David</hi> for it) yet are <hi>uncover'd,</hi> and intend that as an expreſſion of their <hi>reverence</hi> in all acts of <hi>immediate</hi> worſhip. And much leſs did I ever hear any <hi>D ſſenter</hi> alledg ſuch trifling reaſons as theſe, for which his Lp. has not thought fit to produce any Author, and therefore I know none we can <hi>father</hi> 'em on but himſelf. And if he <hi>fram'd</hi> theſe arguments, he dos well to <hi>anſwer</hi> 'em; Or if he have met with ſome in his converſation of ſo ſottiſh an Opinion, that have no better pleas for it, 'tis but juſt he ſhou'd endeavour to ſhew 'em their miſtakes; But why he cannot confute ſuch weak people, without groſs <hi>ſlanders</hi> againſt thoſe that are no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in their errors, I know not; And I deſire his Lp. to conſider what elſe he can make of the following paſſages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 137. Speaking of theſe external poſtures of Reverence, he ſaith, <hi>In caſes of neceſſity we think they may lawfully be omitted; But you are taught that in no caſes they may be lawfully practis'd; You are taught rather to ſtay at home, than to conform in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward geſtures or circumſtances. You are advis'd rather to abſtain all your lives from the Lord's-Supper, than receive it kneeling. Now if you think God hates 'em ſo much, &amp;c. and accounts 'em a polluting his Ordinance, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. If his Lp. cannot produce ſo much as one among the Diſſenting Miniſters that ever taught their people, <hi>That ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures of bodily Worſhip may in no caſes be lawfully practis'd,</hi> then I hope he will own himſelf guilty here of a very <hi>immoral</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. And if he can produce any ſuch perſon, I dare undertake that he ſhall be publickly cenſur'd by his Brethren for teaching ſo ſenſeleſs and ridiculous doctrine. But to make this a general charge againſt us, is the moſt inexcuſable aſperſion that he cou'd poſſibly caſt upon us, and ſuch as we muſt demand from him, that he either <hi>prove,</hi> or ingenuouſly <hi>retract.</hi> I might ſay the ſame
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:134578:69"/> concerning our people's being taught rather to <hi>ſtay at home</hi> than to <hi>conform in their outward geſtures,</hi> if he underſtand this of <hi>ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural geſtures</hi> us'd in the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church.</hi> For what he adds as to <hi>kneeling at the Lord's-Supper,</hi> he cannot be ignorant that ſome of the moſt conſiderable Writers for the NC's Cauſe in <hi>England</hi> have defended the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> of it, tho his Lp. cannot do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradicting himſelf. There are others indeed that do think it <hi>unlawful,</hi> becauſe they think it not only unſutable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and deſign of the Inſtitution, but a needleſs <hi>ſymbolizing</hi> with the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> in a poſture abus'd to the moſt pernicious Idolatry, by which they are the more confirm'd in that Idolatry, notwithſtanding the publick proteſtation of the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church</hi> againſt that <hi>abuſe.</hi> I ſhall therefore only add, That if any refuſe to receive the Sacrament <hi>kneeling,</hi> his Lp. has the leaſt reaſon to blame 'em, who by the <hi>Rubric</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> is oblig'd to give it to none in the Church but ſuch as <hi>kneel;</hi> For ſure 'tis a leſſer fault to be too rigid and ſcrupulous as to our <hi>own</hi> practice, than to impoſe it on <hi>others</hi> too, and to deny them the priviledges of Chriſtian Communion for want of conformity to an <hi>unſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> geſture. If the former run into an extreme, moderate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may have ſome right to reprove 'em, but thoſe have none who run much farther into the other.</p>
            <p>Again, What excuſe can the Bp. have for that paſſage, <hi>p.</hi> 138, 139.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But in your Meetings there is no obligation on any one to ſignifie his concurrence with the Congregation in any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary act of worſhip either by word or geſture, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this end of publick Aſſemblys, (<hi>viz.</hi> to ſignifie our ſenſe and belief of the Being, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of God, and to ſtir up the ſame in others) is utterly defeated by you. The <hi>Directory</hi> dos not require or allow the people ſo much as to ſignifie their aſſent by adding their <hi>Amen</hi> to the Prayers or Thankſgivings there offer'd. But on the contrary, you ridicule thoſe that practice it, purſuant to the directions and examples in Scripture. And
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:134578:69"/> as to geſtures, ſuch as kneeling, ſtanding, or bowing the body, you condemn 'em all as Relicts of Idolatry and Superſtition. There remains therefore in your Aſſemblys nothing whereby the people may teſtifie their belief or aſſent to what they hear, which was one deſign of the Meeting. Thus, by turning all bodily Worſhip out of your Aſſemblys, you have made void this great end of 'em, and left no viſible diſtinction whereby any one may ſignifie whether he aſſents to the Worſhip offer'd, or diſſents from it. The whole aſſembly being to one another, meer Spectators and Hearers, not Joint-Worſhipers.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. His Lp. was I ſuppoſe weary of <hi>retailing</hi> his aſperſions, and therefore here gives 'em to us by <hi>whole-ſale.</hi> For 'tis not true that <hi>there is no obligation on any in our Meetings to ſignifie his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence with the Congregation in any ordinary act of Worſhip by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture.</hi> For the <hi>Directory</hi> requires that ſuch as come into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation ſhou'd <hi>reverently compoſe themſelves to joyn with the Congregation in that Ordinance that is then in hand.</hi> Which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys their joyning in ſuch <hi>devout geſtures</hi> as the nature of that particular Ordinance dos require. And their conſtant atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the ſeveral parts of publick Worſhip, with their <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent</hi> behaviour therein, is a publick <hi>declaration</hi> of their <hi>joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it.</hi> 'Tis again untrue, that the <hi>Directory</hi> dos not allow the people to ſignifie their aſſent to the publick Prayers and Thankſgivings by ſaying <hi>Amen.</hi> For the very <hi>Catechiſm</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by 'em in explication of the <hi>Concluſion</hi> of the <hi>Lord's-Prayer</hi> implys the contrary, that we ſhou'd <hi>in Testimony of our deſire and aſſurance, to be heard ſay Amen.</hi> I confeſs I know not what ſort of modeſty has made it too uſual among us not to repeat our <hi>Amen</hi> ſo loudly as is generally done in the <hi>Pariſh-Churches;</hi> And in this particular I am of the ſame judgment with the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Author of that Sermon in the morning lectures on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>v.</hi> 16. who adviſes the pronouncing it more <hi>aiudibly.</hi> Nor do I know of any <hi>Diſsenters</hi> that ridicule any Conformiſts for doing ſo. But, to charge us (as he here dos) <hi>with condemning kneeling, ſtanding,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:134578:70"/> or bowing down, as Relicts of Idolatry and Superſtition,</hi> is ſo groſs a calumny, and ſo unbecoming a man that pretends to ſincerity &amp; candour, that he is oblig'd in common juſtice to repair the wrong he has here done us.

            <p>For thoſe weak people of whom he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 141. That they object againſt <hi>kneeling</hi> and <hi>ſtanding</hi> in the Congregation, <hi>that 'tis troubleſome to 'em,</hi> They do indeed offer a very lazy excuſe; and if the Bp. has met with any ſuch, he dos well to ſhame 'em out of it. But I can by no means be of the Bp's opinion, that any leave them on this ſcore, becauſe they find a way of Worſhip among the Diſſenters <hi>eaſier</hi> than theirs; Nor do I find that a man can <hi>ſleep</hi> more ſecurely and quietly in the <hi>Meetings</hi> than in the <hi>Pariſh-Churches.</hi> I am ſure I have oftner heard ſuch ſlothful people awaken'd by ſevere reproofs in the <hi>Diſſenters Aſsemblys</hi> than in <hi>theirs.</hi> So that I ſuſpect thoſe will fail of their deſign, who come to our <hi>Meetings</hi> in hopes to take a more <hi>undiſturbed Nap</hi> there</p>
            <p>The Biſhop ſeems, <hi>p</hi> 143. to aſſert, <hi>That kneeling in publick Prayer is a duty which we are bound to provide conveniency for.</hi> But as he wiſely takes it for granted, inſtead of proving it, ſo he groundleſly imagins the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to have ſome averſion to it, whereas I know of no poſture more univerſally us'd by 'em in that duty in their <hi>Cloſets</hi> or <hi>Familys</hi> where they have conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency for it. And I have ſeen it frequently us'd in thoſe larger
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:134578:70"/> Seats in their <hi>Meetings</hi> that were wide enough to allow room for it. So that I perceive his Lordſhip is as great a ſtranger to our judgment and practice, as if he liv'd in ſome remote part of the world, and yet pretends to give an account of it with as much confidence as if he had continually frequented our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblys. I think I may pretend to know 'em better, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt in juſtice to 'em add, that in thoſe Meetings I have frequented, I have obſerv'd as great an appearance of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Reverence</hi> and <hi>Devotion,</hi> of <hi>ſeriouſneſs</hi> and <hi>gravity</hi> as in any other Proteſtant Churches whatſoever either at <hi>home</hi> or <hi>abroad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Biſhop concludes this Chapter with this Obſervation, <q>But the truth of the matter, as it ſeems to me, is, That your neglecting to kneel at the moſt ſolemn of all Chriſtian Ordinances, the Lord's-Supper, dos harden you againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in the other parts of Divine Worſhip: And it is no wonder it ſhou'd do ſo; for if Reverence be not thought neceſſary in that duty, it may well ſeem unneceſſary in any other.</q>
            </p>
            <p>On which words I ſhall only add, That if by <hi>Reverence</hi> in that Ordinance of the Lord's-Supper, he means <hi>kneeling</hi> while we eat the Bread, and drink the Cup, I have ſhew'd him that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> us'd no ſuch <hi>Reverence,</hi> and he may with the ſame juſtice reproach <hi>them</hi> as he dos <hi>us.</hi> But it will by no means follow, that we muſt not uſe a <hi>worſhipping-poſture</hi> when acts of immediate Worſhip are offer'd, becauſe we uſe it not, when no ſuch acts are requir'd; as none are, during our eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking in remembrance of Chriſt in that Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that I may more juſtly obſerve, That his Lordſhip's neglecting ſo long to reaſon ſolidly, and to ſpeak Truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> has ſo harden'd him in the contrary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, that he ſeems reſolv'd to go on in it to the end of the Chapter.</p>
            <pb n="130" facs="tcp:134578:71"/>
            <p>For the practice of the Eſtabliſht Church in reference to <hi>Bodily Worſhip.</hi> I need add nothing to what has been already obſerv'd, (<hi>p.</hi> 123, 124) concerning <hi>bowing at the name of Jeſus, ſtanding up at the Reading ſome part of the Scriptures rather than others, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Cathedrals one part of their Service at the Communion-Table, where few of the people can hear it, &amp;c.</hi> For which practices the Bp. muſt either bring us expreſs ſcriptural <hi>precept</hi> or <hi>pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern,</hi> or muſt cenſure 'em for his ſort of <hi>human Inventions;</hi> and truly ſome of 'em look too like ſuperſtitious ones; For they are either us'd and retain'd for no reaſon at all, but meer arbitrary pleaſure, or for ſuch reaſons as include ſome ſuperſtitious conceit in 'em, as if ſome peculiar honour and homage were due to that name of our Saviour above others, And greater veneration were due to ſome part of Scripture above the reſt; And as if there were either ſome peculiar ſanctity in the <hi>prayers,</hi> or in the <hi>place,</hi> when they are read at the <hi>Communion-Table,</hi> or there were no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter way of inſtructing the people in their obligation to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, than by this dumb ſign of reading ſome part of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Service</hi> there.</p>

            <head>Remarks on the Fifth Chapter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Lord's-Supper.</head>
            <p>And here</p>
            <p n="1">I. FOr the <hi>Account</hi> he gives us of what the Scriptures pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe concerning the <hi>frequency of Celebrating this Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I ſhall very eaſily agree with his Lp.</p>
            <p>For tho I think his Reaſoning from the time of <hi>Celebrating the Paſſover,</hi> and from the general Topic of our <hi>doing it as often as we have conveniency for it,</hi> is not very cogent to prove any obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon us to celebrate this Sacrament <hi>every Lord's-day,</hi> Yet I do think his other arguments from Scripture are of great weight to prove, that in the Apoſtles time this <hi>Ordinance</hi> was made one conſtant part of their <hi>Lord's-days Worſhip,</hi> and I think it paſt doubt that this was the univerſal practice of Chriſtian Churches for ſeveral ſucceeding Ages. So that in this reſpect I fear that the Reformed Churches themſelves have not yet come up to the practice of the truly primitive and Apoſtolical ones, as I truly think were highly deſirable. Many learned Authors, both Conf's and N C's have freely deliver'd their judgments to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and I know of none that have diſputed the matter of fact on which their arguments for reviving this practice are founded. I know there are other judicious perſons that do not think the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments drawn thence to be demonſtrative, and do ſtill conceive the words, <hi>As oft as ye eat this bread,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>do this as oft as ye drink it in remembrance of me,</hi> to leave the <hi>frequency</hi> of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:134578:72"/> this duty to the determination of human prudence. And tho their exceptions do not ſo far weigh with me as to alter my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet I dare not be harſh in cenſuring ſuch whoſe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions herein are different from my own.</p>
            <p>All the Debate then remaining between the Bp. and me, will be concerning</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Practice of the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church</hi> and that of the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the practice of the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church,</hi> I wonder why he ſhou'd pretend their Church has provided for thoſe that deſire to Receive every <hi>Lord's-day,</hi> meerly becauſe of her ordering ſome part of the <hi>Communion-Service</hi> to be read every <hi>Lord's-day,</hi> when 'tis ſo publickly known that there is no <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> provided for ſuch as may be diſpos'd to <hi>Communicate;</hi> And why ſhou'd the people be taught their duty only by ſuch <hi>dumb ſigns</hi> as that? or part of the <hi>Communion-Service</hi> be read when there's no <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> intended? He dos indeed very juſtly obſerve that the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> require no more of every Pariſhioner, than that he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivee <hi>thrice a year;</hi> But why he ſhou'd lay the blame of their people's Receiving no oftner, on the ill example of the <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> I cannot imagin. For if it appear that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Receive far oftner than their <hi>Canons</hi> require, It will be very unaccountable how their example ſhou'd <hi>encourage</hi> that <hi>negligence</hi> of the <hi>Conforming</hi> Laity, which it rather <hi>reproves.</hi> I confeſs, for the method of driving men to the Sacrament by <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,</hi> (if he intend this of the ſevere penaltys that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon a <hi>Writ de Excommunicato Capiendo</hi>) we do not much admire it. To be admitted to the Lord's-Table, we eſteem ſo great a <hi>Priviledg</hi> and <hi>Honour,</hi> that we think none ſhou'd partake of it, but ſuch as do very earneſtly <hi>deſire</hi> and <hi>ſeek it,</hi> and are in the judgment of human charity well <hi>fitted</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd</hi> for it, by <hi>competent knowledg,</hi> and <hi>an inoffenſive converſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="133" facs="tcp:134578:72"/>
            <p>But we do by no means think thoſe deſerve to be admitted at all whom nothing elſe can prevail with to come to this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> but the fear of a <hi>Priſon;</hi> and who are hal'd to that <hi>Holy Table,</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to eſcape the <hi>Jaylor</hi>'s <hi>Clutches.</hi> Nor is it reaſonable to put Men under ſo ſtrong Temptation to diſſemble with God in ſo ſolemn Vows, for the preſervation of their Secular Intereſt. And for thoſe Diſſenters that ſcruple <hi>Kneeling,</hi> Nothing cou'd be more Unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an than to <hi>deny</hi> 'em the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper</hi> without their compliance with that poſture, and yet <hi>puniſh</hi> 'em for not receiving it in their <hi>Pariſh Churches;</hi> which was no better than to puniſh 'em for their <hi>being afraid of ſinning.</hi> And if this be the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> which his Lp. complains of being <hi>weakned,</hi> I know of few moderate and wiſe Men that will be much troubled at it.</p>
            <p>For the Practice of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. He very groundleſly infers, <hi>That becauſe the Directory leaves it to the Miniſters,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to determine how often this Inſtitution ſhall be celebrated, that they exclude it by this Rule, from being an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſtant part of God's Service.</hi> For no more can be juſtly drawn from thoſe words, than that they left the matter to the liberty of thoſe that had the over ſight and care of particular Congregations. So that if any Miniſters thought the conſtant celebration of this Sacrament every <hi>Lords Day,</hi> moſt convenient for the comfort and edification of their People, this Rule does by no means <hi>forbid,</hi> but rather <hi>enforce</hi> their doing it. But thoſe indeed that think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, are no farther impos'd on by this Rule, than to be oblig'd to do it <hi>frequently,</hi> which the <hi>Directory</hi> (as the Bp. owns) expreſly requires; and I doubt not they intended by frequently, oftner than thrice a year. Nor can I imagine why he ſhould any more compare <hi>our</hi> practice with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> than their <hi>own:</hi> For do the <hi>Pariſh-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters</hi> every Lord's-day <hi>offer the Sacrament to the People,</hi> or <hi>invite 'em to it,</hi> or <hi>afford 'em opportunities for it,</hi> any more than the <hi>Diſſenters?</hi> Or rather do not the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> generally afford 'em opportunities much oftner? Why ſhould he then ſo ſeverely condemn the <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:134578:73"/> for what they are leſs guilty of than <hi>themſelves?</hi> If he pretend that the Sacrament is <hi>offer'd,</hi> becauſe part of the <hi>Communion-Service</hi> is read; Does he not know that if the People take that for an Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, they'll find themſelves diſappointed? And ſure 'tis better to make no offer of it than a <hi>deluſory</hi> one.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He very confidently aſſerts, <hi>That the Diſſenters rarely preſs the People to Communion; They have few Sermons or Diſcourſes to that purpoſe; And many of 'em condemn our Zeal for endeavouring to reſtore the conſtant Communion precedented in Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis ſtrange that his Lp. ſhould continually put us on ſo ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a Task, as the denying the Truth of what he ſaith, by advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing ſuch groundleſs Accuſations; I am ſure the generality of 'em adminiſter this Sacrament far oftener than the generality of the Conforming Clergy; and 'tis ſeldom or never adminiſtred without their taking occaſion to preſs People to it. Nor do I find any of their Printed Diſcourſes on that ſubject, that omit their doing it: Nay, I am enclin'd to believe there are as many N. C. Writers as Conformiſts, that have preach'd and wrote for reſtoring the <hi>conſtant Communion precedented in Scripture.</hi> And one wou'd think that Experience ſhou'd be ſufficient to convince him that the <hi>Diſſenting</hi> Miniſters <hi>preſs it more.</hi> For of thoſe that attend the <hi>Pariſh-Churches</hi> and the <hi>Meetings,</hi> I think 'tis evident, that if we make allowance for the Numbers in general of thoſe of each Perſwaſion the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions</hi> of the Diſſenters will be found much more <hi>numerous</hi> as well as more <hi>frequent.</hi> I confeſs, if his Lp. only mean, That we do not <hi>promiſcuouſly</hi> urge <hi>all People</hi> to come to this Ordinance, how <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant</hi> or <hi>wicked</hi> ſoever, 'tis true; and I hope he will not blame us for that, unleſs he think we may turn the Church into a <hi>common ſink</hi> and <hi>receptacle</hi> of profligate Sinners, and invite <hi>Swine</hi> to that H. Table. (For ſuch are all <hi>notoriouſly vitious perſons</hi> in the Language of the Scripture.) On the contrary, we have too great reaſon to complain, that too many ſuch are admitted in the Pariſh-Churches, notwithſtanding the ineffectual Proviſion of the <hi>Rubrick</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> againſt this <hi>Abuſe;</hi> of which no Reformation can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to any purpoſe, till particular <hi>Paſtors</hi> be reſtored to the due Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:134578:73"/> of their <hi>Paſtoral Power.</hi> But for thoſe that have <hi>competent Knowledge,</hi> and are of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nblameable Deportment,</hi> they are frequently urg'd to attend this <hi>Inſtitution;</hi> and particularly in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Miniſter in viſiting the ſeveral Diſtricts, enquires of the Elders concerning ſuch, that beſides the general <hi>Invitation</hi> from the Pulpit, he may particularly urge 'em to their Duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>'Tis worſe than their Principles;</hi> and concerning it he adds theſe remarkable words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I appeal to you, Whether it is not reckoned a great thing among many of you, if once in a year or two, a Communion be celebrated in one of your Meetings? Nay, among ſome of you 'tis often omitted for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years together, and in ſome places for ten or more. I fear I may ſay, Your People generally have too little ſenſe of the Obligation of Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it at all; and your Miniſters indulge 'em ſo far in this Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that a man may live comfortably among you, and with the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of a Profeſſor, to Thirty or Forty years of Age, and never Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at all. And by the beſt Enquiry I cou'd make, I cou'd not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute that above One in Ten that go to your Meetings, ever Receive through the whole Courſe of their Lives, notwithſtanding Chriſts po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Command to do it in remembrance of him. So unhappily are Men overſeen in laying aſide the Commands of God for their own Inventions. I ſhould be glad to find that I were miſtaken in this Computation. In the mean time you muſt give me leave to tell you plainly, That this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of rare or no Communion, is ſo peculiarly your own, that I think you are altogether ſingular in it; and are ſo far from having any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent for it in Scripture, that I doubt whether any Precedent can be found for you even among the moſt degenerate and barbarous People that ever call'd themſelves Chriſtians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> In order to our paſſing a right Judgment on this Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Bp's, I muſt give a brief Account of matter of Fact. For thoſe <hi>Meetings</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> where Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors are ſettl'd, the moſt of 'em conſtantly celebrate the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>once a Month,</hi> others <hi>once in ſix Weeks, or two Months,</hi> and a few <hi>once every Lord's Day.</hi> I do not believe there are Six that have it ſo ſeldom as <hi>once a Quarter.</hi> So that if the Bp. ſpeak here of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:134578:74"/> generality of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> (as we have reaſon to ſuppoſe, becauſe he does not here (as elſewhere) confine his Charge to any part of 'em) To reproach them as guilty of <hi>rare or no Communion not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedented among the moſt degenerate and barbarous People that were ever called Chriſtians,</hi> is a Calumny of ſuch a hainous nature, that I ſhall in meer Civility and reſpect to his Character, forbear to treat it as it deſerves; and ſhall only deſire him to bring the <hi>Pariſh-Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> to that <hi>frequency of Communion</hi> ſo generally practiſed among the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> before he treat us any more with ſuch rude Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as we might with ſo much advantage retort. If his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip pretend that he deſign'd to confine this to the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> tho' he has expreſt no ſuch thing; yet how little ground he had for this heavy Charge, will appear upon a due Examination of matter of Fact: Of which I have this Account given by thoſe that know it much better than he can pretend to do.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſo far from being true, that <hi>'tis rare if once in a year or two a Communion be celebrated in their Meetings,</hi> that it's univerſally uſual in every <hi>Meeting</hi> where an ordained Miniſter is ſettled, to have the Lord's Supper adminiſtred conſtantly <hi>Once a year,</hi> and <hi>Twice</hi> in the larger Towns. And what is more conſiderable, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever 'tis adminiſtred, 'tis uſual for <hi>Two Thirds</hi> of the Congregation to be <hi>Strangers.</hi> For 'tis their Cuſtom in the <hi>North</hi> to have very large and <hi>numerous Communions,</hi> ſo that when the Sacrament is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in one <hi>Meeting,</hi> 'tis uſual for moſt of the Members of Neighbouring Pariſhes to frequent it: To which purpoſe they bring <hi>Certificates</hi> (or <hi>Communicatory Letters</hi>) from their own Miniſters. So that the generality of 'em (as I am aſſur'd) do <hi>communicate four or five times in a year;</hi> many of them do it <hi>much oftner;</hi> and all of 'em have the opportunity of doing it <hi>ten, twelve, or fifteen times a year,</hi> if they will take the Advantage of receiving it as often as 'tis adminiſtred within a few miles of their reſpective Habitations. And they alledge theſe two or three Reaſons that have induc'd 'em to this Method, 1. That hereby the vaſt Number of Communicants tends to increaſe the Solemnity of the Inſtitution, and repreſents in a more affecting manner the <hi>Communion of Saints.</hi> 2. That every <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:134578:74"/> having uſually but one Miniſter, 'tis requiſite the Miniſters of Neighbouring Pariſhes ſhould aſſiſt 'em on that occaſion; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently they uſually bring their People along with 'em. 3. That the Miniſters of particular Congregations prepare their own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for it, by viſiting 'em round, examining every particular Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber anew, about their ſpiritual Eſtate, and making due Enquiry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their Converſation; all which takes up a conſiderable time. This being a juſt account of their practice, tho' I muſt freely profeſs I do prefer the general practice of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> elſewhere, of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> in each <hi>Congregation once a Month,</hi> and cou'd heartily wiſh it were made a conſtant part of the <hi>Lord's-day Worſhip;</hi> yet I ſee not with what tolerable Juſtice the <hi>Bp.</hi> cou'd upbraid 'em with their <hi>rare or no Communion,</hi> when the Members of their <hi>Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> do generally communicate much <hi>oftner</hi> than the Members of the <hi>Pariſh-Churches:</hi> Nay, when their Miniſters not celebrating it in each particular <hi>Meeting,</hi> is occaſion'd by ſo extraordinary care taken to prepare their People for it: Whereas there can be no other Account given why the Pariſh-Miniſters who take no ſuch pains with their People, adminiſter it ſo ſeldom, but either their <hi>own La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs,</hi> or the <hi>People's Indevotion.</hi> And whereas he ſaith, <hi>A man may live among 'em with the reputation of a Profeſſor, to Thirty or Forty Years, and never receive at all;</hi> If he mean by a <hi>Profeſſor,</hi> a Perſon accounted truly <hi>Religious,</hi> they declare they know not of one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that kind. And whereas he ſaith, <hi>Not one in ten that go to their Meetings receive through the whole courſe of their Lives,</hi> they do profeſs, that by the beſt computation they can make, there is not one in ten, or rather in 20 or 30, that <hi>do not receive,</hi> except ſuch as are with-held for want of <hi>competent Knowledge,</hi> or on the account of <hi>Scandal;</hi> and thoſe that communicate once, do it ordinarily on all following occaſions.</p>
            <p>So that upon the whole, the <hi>Bp.</hi> is much more concern'd to find a <hi>Precedent</hi> for the generality of the Members of Pariſh-Churches in <hi>their rare or no Communion,</hi> than the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are for the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their Congregations. And much more is he concern'd to find a <hi>Precedent</hi> for himſelf in his ſo rarely ſpeaking truth concerning the <hi>Diſſenters;</hi> and I fear that he will hardly find any (if I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:134578:75"/> him his civil expreſſions) except among <hi>the moſt degenerate and barbarous Writers that were ever called Chriſtians,</hi> I mean thoſe <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Prieſts,</hi> who in their writing againſt Proteſtants have acquir'd a peculiar dexterity in the practice of that Unchriſtian Maxim, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniare fortiter, aliquid adhaerebit, Throw dirt enough, and ſome of it will ſtick.</hi>

Since we agree in the Articles of Religion profeſt by the Eſtabliſh'd Church (to which, by the way, the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> of the two more ſtrictly adhere); ſince (as himſelf owns, p, 4.) we agree about the inward part of Divine Worſhip; Nay, ſince we agree in the ſame external parts of it, <hi>Praiſe, Prayer, Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>the Lord's Supper;</hi> and only diſagree about the mode of ordering thoſe external Duties: Is it not moſt unreaſonable, and contrary to Chriſtian Charity, and I might add to common ſence, to ſpeak of ſuch as in theſe Circumſtantial Modes differ from him, as <hi>fallen off from the Church, and diſ-believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Report of the Goſpel?</hi> What is this but to turn the <hi>Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Modes of Worſhip</hi> into <hi>Fundamentals,</hi> and thereby to turn the Reformed Church in this Kingdom into a <hi>Sect</hi> and <hi>Party,</hi> i. e. to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the groſſeſt ſort of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and moſt oppoſite to <hi>Chriſtian Love?</hi> I hope I have in theſe Papers ſhewn our manner of performing theſe Duties, to be more agreeable to Scriptural <hi>Precept</hi> and <hi>Pattern,</hi> and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:134578:75"/> yet I wou'd ſooner ſuffer my Right Hand to be cut off, than that any ſuch Expreſſion ſhould drop from my Pen, that ſhould thus confine the Church of Chriſt to the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and cenſure others as <hi>fallen off from it.</hi> For I honour the <hi>Pariſh Churches</hi> as a very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent part of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and ſuch as compar'd with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Greek, Abiſſine,</hi> &amp;c. Churches, has attained to an excellent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Reformation.</p>
            <p>P. 167, 168. He ſuggeſts to his Clergy, <hi>That they cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be zealous in their Office out of any private Intereſt, or proſpect of particular profit, becauſe their Maintenance and Preferments are aſcertained by Law, and depend not on the voluntary Contribution of the People;</hi> and he inſinuates on the other hand, <hi>That the Diſſenters are more liable to be acted by other Motives, ſince they muſt attain to Honour or Support by making or gaining a Party.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> If the <hi>Diſſenting</hi> Miniſters be acted in their <hi>Nonconformity</hi> by a Regard to Temporal Intereſt, they deſerve to be begg'd for <hi>Fools.</hi> Does he think that upon their Conforming, they might not aſpire to Eccleſiaſtical Dignities and Preferments as well as others, if their Judgments cou'd comply with all the <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions</hi> that are requir'd? How many cou'd I name him, no way inferiour to his Lp. in any Miniſterial Abilities, who never had ſo much as 100 <hi>l.</hi> a year from their People, while he enjoys, by <hi>common Report,</hi> a <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> worth 2000? Not that they <hi>envy</hi> him his <hi>Wealth,</hi> but they think it unreaſonable he ſhould <hi>upbraid them</hi> with their <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,</hi> as if it laid 'em under Temptations to <hi>counter act their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to ſerve their Intereſt,</hi> when if they cou'd have done ſo, they never needed to expoſe themſelves to thoſe Neceſſities. For it's plain that, quite contrary to what he ſuggeſts, the Temptation of Intereſt lies chiefly on the other ſide. What <hi>Intereſt</hi> can influence thoſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Miniſters to <hi>make</hi> or <hi>gain a Party,</hi> who are ſure to be <hi>Loſers</hi> by their <hi>adhering</hi> to it, and have all poſſible proſpect of <hi>bettering</hi> their Condition by <hi>forſaking</hi> it? And how much greater danger are thoſe in of being influenc'd by it, whoſe exceſſive Preferments de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on their turning the <hi>Church</hi> into a <hi>Party,</hi> by keeping up nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row uncharitable terms of <hi>Miniſterial Communion?</hi> And why ſhould he think the Inferior Clergy may not be mov'd to be <hi>zealous in their
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:134578:76"/> Office,</hi> from a proſpect of Intereſt and Profit? Does he think himſelf and his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren Immortal? May they <hi>never</hi> expect a Fall of Church-Preferments? Or are thoſe Preferments ſo corruptly diſtributed, that no diligence of an inferior Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man in his Office will ſignifie any thing to recommend him to 'em? Does Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or Bribes ſo entirely prevail as to exclude all conſideration of Merit? Either he reaſons very weakly here, or elſe he inſinuates what is very little to the credit of the Church.</p>
            <p>P. 88. He does well to remind 'em, <hi>that they are Miniſters of the Goſpel, not of a Party.</hi> Anſw. But why then does he ſpeak of all that diſſent from 'em, as <hi>fallen from the Church,</hi> and become <hi>Infidels?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He alſo in the ſame page juſtly ſpeaks <hi>of our differences as of little concern, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively with the common Intereſt of Holineſs and Religion:</hi> But when he tells us <hi>of theſe differences being inſiſted on only as the occaſions &amp; Badges of thoſe People who being reſolved to ſeparate themſelves, are oblig'd to take up little differences for a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction:</hi> I would gladly know who are moſt chargeable with <hi>taking up little Differences</hi> to make 'em the <hi>Diſtinguiſhing Badges of a Party;</hi> They that arbitrarily impoſe ſuch <hi>Unneceſſary Terms</hi> of Miniſterial and Chriſtian Communion, as our Common Lord never requir'd, and ſo make their own dividing <hi>Hedge</hi> and <hi>Encloſure</hi> in his ſacred <hi>Vineyard,</hi> or they that only ſcruple <hi>compliance</hi> with theſe ſuſpected Terms, and deſire that the Common Rule of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> may be the only Rule of <hi>Conformity?</hi> They that on the account of theſe Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences cry up themſelves alone as the Church, or they that plead only to be a part of it, or at moſt a more uncorrupted part? One wou'd think the former look more like perſons reſolv'd to ſeparate themſelves, eſpecially when they contrive ſuch Racks for mens Judgments and Conſciences as the Act of <hi>Uniformity</hi> contains. And the latter cannot reaſonably be ſuppoſed ſo obſtinate, unleſs he imagine 'em fond of Poverty and Miſery, and in love with Separation for its own ſake.</p>
            <p>P. 169. He ſuggeſts, <hi>That while they have been defending their Common Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity againſt Papiſts, Deiſts and Socinians, the Diſſenters have taken that advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to undermine 'em with their People, nay that ſome of 'em have even joyn'd with thoſe Enemies to pull down their Conſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I think it is apparent that the Diſſenters have rarely wrote in defence of their own Cauſe, without being aſſaulted firſt. It was he firſt ſtarted the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie in this Kingdom, by excluding 'em from the Catholick Church. It is he has again renew'd it by a freſh Charge of our Worſhip having little of <hi>God</hi>'s im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Appointment, but abundance of Humane Inventions. Now if we be guilty, 'tis indeed reaſonable we ſhould be ſilent; But if innocent, does he think our Reputation too inconſiderable to be worthy of a Defence againſt the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and yet the moſt unrighteous Accuſations? And if he did formerly with the ſame Sword attempt to ſtab his Popiſh Adverſaries and his Diſſenting Brethren, can he blame them for warding it off themſelves, eſpecially when at the ſame time they warded it off from the generality of the Reformed Churches, (whoſe Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he muſt have wounded through our ſides) and directed the point of it more fully againſt the Papiſts.</p>
            <pb n="141" facs="tcp:134578:76"/>
            <p>But I would gladly know, who thoſe Diſſenters are that join'd with the <hi>Papiſts, Deiſts,</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> in a Confederacy to pull down their Conſtitution. For I cannot imagine what ground he has for this Charge, unleſs he refers to the attempts made in the late King <hi>James</hi>'s time towards the Repeal of the Penal Laws and Teſt. And if he intend that, dos he not know, That there were far more of their Clergy, even the Dignitaries of their Church, that join'd in that deſign with the Court, then of Diſſenting Miniſters, of whom I could never hear of above One or Two concern'd, and even they had been both exaſperated by the barbarous Execution of thoſe Laws upon themſelves. And was it more criminal in them to attempt to burn the Rod that had ſo unmercifully laſh't 'em, then in thoſe to join in that deſign who had no other temptation then hope of Court-Favour and Preferment? Nay dos he not know that the Body of the Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Miniſters and People generouſly refus'd to concur in that deſign when earneſtly ſolicited to it; meerly becauſe they valu'd the general Intereſt of the Reformed Religion, before any ſeperate Intereſt of their own. And wou'd not a man of candour and ingenuity, have rather commended the carriage of the main body of 'em, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach't 'em with the faults of ſo few, (in which he knows they might recriminate with ſo much advantage) eſpecially when ſuch as reproach 'em were ſo acceſſary to thoſe faults by unchriſtian rigor and cruelty? And by the way, If by their <hi>Conſtitution</hi> he means our frame of Dioceſan Epiſcopacy and Government, why dos he ſuggeſt our concurrence with Papiſts to pull it down, when he knows well enough, if the Papiſts were in power, they would continue and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſame Conſtitution, and only change the Perſons.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>II.</hi> For that part of the Concluſion which is addreſt to the <hi>Diſſenting Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Derry.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>FIrſt, <hi>I do fully concur with him in his Advice; Not to treat one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother with ſcurrilous, and unſeemly Reflections.</hi> But I hope he will not account thoſe ſuch, wherein a Man is juſtly reprov'd for groſs Miſrepreſentations of other Men's Opinions and Practices, when he might eaſily have inform'd himſelf better; or a trifling Argument not always treated with <hi>grimace,</hi> but ſometimes with the <hi>ſlight</hi> it deſerves.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>I do alſo heartily concur with him in his requeſt to 'em, That they will not make the difference between us ſeem greater then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally it is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I hope he will find it punctually obſerv'd in theſe Remarks, in which I have ſo often diſclaim'd the Advantage given me by his own Principles to cenſure ſeveral practices in the Eſtabliſh't Church as unlawful. And therefore I hope I may, without offence, humbly requeſt his Lp. to take his own Advice; And truly if he had done ſo ſooner, he had ſpar'd me the ungrateful labour of theſe Remarks on his late Diſcourſe, which I hope may convince him, That the tendency of his whole Book is to make the difference between us ſeem greater then it is; partly by miſreporting our Principles and Practices, and partly by an unreaſonable charge of <hi>human Inventions in the worſhip of God,</hi> that has no other foundation, then either thoſe miſreports, or that neceſſary uſe of Chriſtian Prudence in determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſome circumſtantial modes of Worſhip, which they make as well as we, and muſt be made in order to the Execution of God's own Commands relating to his Worſhip. Nay it ſeems to be the main purpoſe of his Diſcourſe to repreſent the Worſhip of Diſſenters, as ſo corrupted by human Inventions; that 'tis become vain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable to God; Which is a Cenſure that Charity forbids me to paſs on the Worſhip of the Eſtabliſht Church, tho I think I have prov'd that of the Diſſenters much more conformable to Evangelical
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:134578:77"/> Precept and Pattern. For I doubt not a gracious God makes merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full allowance for manifold culpable Imperfections, where the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is in the main agreable to his Word, and thoſe that offer it thro weakneſs diſcern 'em not. But I perceive 'tis far eaſier to give good Advice then to take it.</p>
               <p>And for the particular Requeſts which his Lp. dos here in ſo friendly a manner, addreſs to the Diſſenting Miniſters of his Dioceſs, I ſhall take the liberty to interpoſe my ſingle Opinion. As.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I can freely concur with him in recommending that uſe of the Lord's-Prayer, which as he juſtly obſerves, the <hi>Directory</hi> approves, becauſe I take it to be a very comprehenſive ſummary of the matter of Prayer delivered in the moſt accurate method and order. But then I muſt add, that as this uſe of it, in our publick Aſſemblies, is not with any certainty determined in Scripture, ſo 'tis a matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in good men may well exerciſe their mutual forbearance and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I do as freely concur with him in deſiring 'em to endeavour the reforming that Irreverent practice, which too many of their Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſeem to endulge themſelves too far in; <hi>viz.</hi> Of <hi>Sitting</hi> in the time of publick Prayer. 'Tis contrary to the general practiſe of their Brethern elſewhere, and I think of all the Reformed Churches, and what is more conſiderable very diſagreable to the Precepts and Examples propos'd in the Holy Scriptures. And I hope his Lp. will think the more open Irreverence, and Levity, too common in many Pariſh Churches to need as effectual Reformation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I do alſo concur with him in deſiring 'em to adhere more ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Advice of the Directory, by more frequent celebration of the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> in each particular Congregation.</p>
               <p>For tho I am fully ſatisfi'd by their Accounts of matter of Fact, that their Members do ordinarily Communicate more frequently than thoſe of the Pariſh Churches; and that n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne has the name of a Profeſſor among 'em that lives in the neglect of this duty, quite contrary to the <hi>Bp's</hi> ſuppoſition; yet I look on the practiſe of their Brethren in <hi>England,</hi> as in this particular, more conformable
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:134578:78"/> to the rule of the Scriptures, among whom 'tis adminiſtred much oftner in each Congregation. For I think it highly probable, that it was in the Apoſtles time one conſtant part of the Lords day's Worſhip. I know this is not ſo practicable among 'em, while they take ſo extraordinary pains with the People every time they admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter this Ordinance to 'em. But I do not ſee any abſolute neceſſity of that: they may continue their ſtated particular Viſitations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making 'em neceſſary to every Communion. And perhaps there may be too great a difference put between this and other parts of Divine Worſhip, by imagining that the frequent Celebration of it wou'd tend to leſſen the Reverence due to it. To all that are ſerious, the frequent Renewal of their Vows on the Memorials of a Crucified Saviour is the moſt likely and effectual means to keep their Souls under the conſtant awe of 'em. But the treating this Subject, as it deſerves, wou'd require a large Diſcourſe. I ſhall therefore only fubjoin, That I hope his Lp. will take his own Advice, by endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to have the Sacrament more frequently adminiſtred in the Pariſh Churches, and eſpecially that he will put his Clergy on imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the Zeal and Diligence of the Diſſenting Miniſters, in their care to prepare their People for ſo ſolemn an Inſtitution, and to keep thoſe from it, whoſe open and notorious wickedneſs tends to infect others by the contagion of their Example, and to proſtitute the honour of Religion to the contempt of an Atheiſtical and Prophane Age.</p>
               <p n="4">4. For this Advice about Reading the Scriptures, I ſhall ſo far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with him; that I wiſh the Rule of the Directory for reading One entire Chapter out of each Teſtament may be obſerv'd, when the ſhortneſs of the days will not leave room for Expoſition, without exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that other way of reading parallel Texts, that occurs in what we call Preaching. But I muſt beg his Lp's pardon for preferring the Reading One Chapter with a clear Expoſition of it from parallel Texts to the bare Reading two, or three, or more, without it; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his ſo confidently obtruding upon us his former ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Conceit, as if it were an undoubted Truth, <hi>That 'tis a carnal and ſinful humour in the People to be fonder of Sermons and Lectures
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:134578:78"/> of human Compoſure, then of the pure Word of God in it's naked ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> For if he mean by it, <hi>That 'tis a carnal and ſinful humour to be fonder of having the word of God read, explained, and applied, then barely read,</hi> (as certainly he muſt if he ſpeak any thing here to the purpoſe.) This is (as I have already ſhewn him) no wiſer a conceit, then if he ſhou'd tell us, 'Tis a carnal and ſinful humour to be more affected with the word of God when we clearly underſtand it, then when we do not. And if ſo, why ſhou'd this ſinful humour of the People be indulg'd by preaching at all? Why ſhou'd any pains be taken to inform their Judgments by leading 'em into the true ſenſe of it? Or rather; why ſhou'd the Bp. ſo weakly oppoſe the purity and ſimplicity of the naked Word of God to a clear Expoſition of it? which us'd to be oppos'd only to the mixture of other doctrines that are either contrary to, or at leaſt not deliver'd in thoſe inſpired Writings. For tho Sermons and Lectures be in part of human Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, yet ſuch as truly anſwer that Character, are nothing elſe but the naked and pure Word of God explained and enforc't upon the Conſciences of the People, without any mixture of foreign, or corrupt doctrines. For even in their Sermons themſelves, a great part of the time is ſpent by the People in conſulting and comparing various parts of the word of God. And if ſuch human Compoſures adulterate the ſimplicity of the Word of God, Why ſhou'd they not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded altogether, and the Clergy be turn'd into meer Readers? Or rather, may we not in ſuch confus'd and deceitful Reaſonings as theſe, ſuſpect a carnal humour in men's crying up the bare Reading the Word of God, to ſhift off the unwelcom Labour of Expounding it. And therefore I ſhou'd rather recommend the practiſe of the Diſſenters in their conſtant <hi>Expounding</hi> as well as <hi>Reading,</hi> to the imitation of the Conforming Clergy; And I wou'd particularly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe his Lp. not to ſpeak ſo ſlightly on all occaſions concerning Sermons, becauſe Preaching has hitherto been accounted the moſt valuable Talent that he is maſter of.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For his 5th. Advice. 'Tis indeed true that many learned and ſober Non Conformiſts have judg'd occaſional Communion with the Pariſh-Churches in the ordinary Lords day worſhip lawful, and have
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:134578:79"/> adviſed their People to practiſe it where they cou'd have no other opportunities of Publick Worſhip. Nay many of 'em have vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and practis'd ſuch occaſional Communion with 'em in the Lords Supper (tho I queſtion whether any of 'em fully approve it in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Baptiſm.) And tho I have no pretence to the firſt of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters he gives ſuch Non Conformiſts yet he will find the ſame charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble temper and practiſe recommended in the Reflections on his Anſwer to Dean <hi>Manby, p.</hi> 64. But methinks his Lp. ſhou'd, when he conſiders the truly chriſtian moderation of ſuch <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> reflect with ſome concern on his own uncharitable Principles to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards 'em, in that <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> which he has never yet diſown'd. And it wou'd ſeem very unreaſonable in him to be too perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory in demanding this from the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> unleſs he wou'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs equal charity on his part, and declare the <hi>lawfulneſs of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with their Churches.</hi> And ſince he cannot deny but that he has ſo fair Examples of <hi>Catholick Charity</hi> ſet before him, I hope he will follow 'em; For otherwiſe this <hi>Requeſt</hi> will appear on his ſide very <hi>partial</hi> and <hi>unreaſonable.</hi> And I hope this diſcourſe may convince him that we have no ſinful <hi>human Inventions</hi> among us to affright him from <hi>Communion</hi> with us; Much leſs do we make ſuch Inventions the <hi>Conditions</hi> of our <hi>Communion</hi> in any part of Gods inſtituted Worſhip. Nay ſince he ſo earneſtly urges our <hi>occaſional Communion</hi> with them, I wou'd deſire him to render it more practicable by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving that unhappy Bar to it which the 5th. <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Church of Ireland</hi> lays in our way. For by that <hi>Canon</hi> All are denounc'd <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comunicated, who ſhall affirm and maintain that there are within this Realm other Meetings, Aſſemblys or Congregations, then ſuch as by the Laws of this Land are held &amp; allow'd, which may rightly challenge to themſelves the name of true and lawful Churches,</hi> and 'tis order'd that <hi>ſuch be not reſtor'd till they repent and revoke their Error.</hi> Now he knows we all affirm and maintain our Churches to be <hi>true and lawful ones,</hi> and therefore are by the <hi>Canon Excomunicated.</hi> Nor can we be without a plain violation of this <hi>Canon readmitted</hi> without retracting what we are ſo far from accounting an <hi>Error,</hi> that we think the contrary Opinion a very uncharitable one. So that to invite us to <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:134578:79"/> with 'em while this <hi>Canon</hi> ſtands in force againſt us, is but to <hi>tantalize</hi> us, and offer us with one hand what they withhold with the other. And there are but two ways to remove this obſtacle to our Communion with 'em, <hi>viz.</hi> either to diſcard that rigid and ſour <hi>Canon,</hi> or to procure an <hi>Act of Indulgence,</hi> and then our Aſſemblys being <hi>allow'd</hi> by the Law will not come within the reach of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For his Advice to the <hi>Diſſenting Miniſters</hi> of <hi>Derry,</hi> to <hi>warn their People againſt ſuch Books as maintain principles contrary both to theirs and thoſe of the Eſtabliſh't Church,</hi> ſince he is pleas'd to name one of my <hi>own,</hi> I am more particularly concern'd to conſider what dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>principles</hi> it contains.</p>
               <p>Now of the <hi>principles</hi> lay'd down in thoſe <hi>Books,</hi> and the <hi>principles</hi> common to him with the <hi>Presbyt.

So then we both own National and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Churches as well as ſingle Worſhiping Congregations; But the Congregational Diſſenters deny, that Chriſt inſtituted any other Church beſides a ſingle Congregation, and affirm that all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches, ſuch as Claſſical, Provincial, or National, are human Inventions, and that every ſingle Congregation is independent, and may indeed keep a fair Correſpondence with it's neighbouring Congregations, but it is not under any common Government with 'em.

For I know none of thoſe Reverend Authors he has nam'd, that wou'd take this for either an accurate or juſt Account of their Sentiments in this matter; I am ſure neither Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Humphreys</hi> wou'd: And 'tis no way ingenuous in the Bp. to give us this confus'd ſtuff as Mr. <hi>Baxters Principles</hi> who has deliver'd his thoughts on this Subject ſo often and ſo largely, and with ſo admirable accuracy &amp; clearneſs; So that I ſhall rather chooſe to refer the Reader to his many excellent Writings relating to this Subject of Church-Goverment, then to attempt to give any Abſtract of his Judgment from 'em. But for my own <hi>Principles,</hi> I know none I have yet avow'd but what are contain'd in the <hi>Reflections</hi> upon the Bp's. Anſwer to Dean <hi>Manby,</hi> having no where elſe deliver'd my Sentiments in reference to <hi>Church Goverment;</hi> And for thoſe I appeal to the Reader whether the Bp. have done me any juſtice in his Repreſentation of 'em. And to that purpoſe I muſt beg the Readers pardon for tranſcribing thoſe Two paſſages in the <hi>Reflections</hi> which are the only places that relate to this purpoſe.</p>

                     <hi>P:</hi> 17 Particular Churches are the chief integrating parts of the Church-Catholick. Theſe Churches conſiſts of one or more Paſtors, and a Chriſtian Flock aſſociated under his or their overſight for perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Communion in Faith, Worſhip, and Holy Living. Theſe Churches are oblig'd by the very dictates of the Light of Nature, and general Rules of the H. Scripture, to endeavour the preſervation of all neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Unity by the amicable conſultations of their aſſociated Paſtors. The judgment of ſuch aſſociated Paſtors ſhou'd be ſubmitted to by the People under their care, when 'tis not repugnant to the Word of God, and contrary to the Intereſt of Religion. But the people do
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:134578:80"/> not owe 'em a blind obedience, nor have ſuch Paſtors any power but for Edification. Much leſs can ſuch Biſhops pretend to a higher pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whoſe very office Chriſt never inſtituted, and whoſe pretended Relation to their Dioceſs is not founded on the Peopl's conſent to it. And if ſuch Biſhops ſhou'd claim the ſole power of Church-Government in a Nation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>So <hi>p.</hi> 57, 58. Having there objected againſt the <hi>Bp's.</hi> Aſſertion, <hi>That the ſupreme Government of our Church has always been in a Natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Council, or Convocation, That</hi> Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> (now <hi>Bp</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter) durſt not own ſuch an Eccleſiaſtical Governing Head of the Church of England,</hi> And that <hi>neither the Light of Nature, nor general Laws of Scripture, wou'd ſuggeſt ſuch an Aſſembly (i. e.</hi> one ſo choſen and conſtituted) <hi>as the Governing Head of the Church of England,</hi> I then add, <q>A duly elected Synod of Paſtors in a Nation, to endeavour the neareſt unity and Concord of the particular Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches (as far as 'tis to be expected on Earth) by their amicable Conſultations, we grant to be moſt deſirable and eligible wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may be had. And the Judgment of ſuch a Synod ſhou'd be comply'd with in all things not repugnant to the word of God. But we cannot ſay ſo of an Aſſembly chiefly compos'd of Men, whoſe Office is not only an Uſurpation, but ſuch as renders true Church Government impoſſible, and whoſe Intereſt and grandure inclines 'em to keep up the Diviſions and Corruptions which they have made. And ſo ſuch a Convocations being entruſted by Chriſt, with the National Church Government which Mr. <hi>K.</hi> is pleaſed to aſſert, I oppoſe the judgment of the truly learned Archbp. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> which he often profeſt to Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <hi>That Church Councills are not for Government, but for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, Not as being in order of Government over the ſeveral Biſhops, but that by Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they may know their Duty more clearly, and by agreement maintain <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, and to that end they were anciently celebrated.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since then this is all I have aſſerted in this matter, How comes the <hi>Bp.</hi> to ſay, 'Tis my <hi>avowed Principle, That Chriſt inſtituted no other Church beſides a ſingle Congregation, and, that all other Churches, ſuch as Claſſical, Provincial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or National, are human Inventions and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:134578:81"/> that every ſingle Congregation is independent and may indeed keep a fair Correſpondence with it's neighbouring Congregations, but it is not under any common Government with 'em,</hi> when there is not one of theſe <hi>Propoſitions</hi> in the <hi>Reflections;</hi> nay, when I am ſo far from <hi>avowing</hi> 'em that there is not one of 'em that I can aſſent to as here lay'd down by his Lp. And what Authority can he pretend to declare for me what my <hi>avowed Principles</hi> are? If he had any thing to ſay againſt the <hi>Reflections,</hi> he ſhou'd in common juſtice have quoted my <hi>Words,</hi> and given me leave to ſpeak my own <hi>Thoughts;</hi> (as I have done by him in theſe <hi>Remarks</hi>) At leaſt he ſhou'd not have obtruded upon me what I never <hi>ſaid</hi> or <hi>thought.</hi> 'Tis none of my <hi>Principle, That Chriſt inſtituted no other Church beſides particular Congregations.</hi> For I believe he inſtituted both the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and ſuch <hi>National</hi> or <hi>Kingdom Churches</hi> (as that great Light of his Age, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> pleads for in his late Diſcourſe on that Subject) <hi>i. e.</hi> a Society conſtituted of a Chriſtian Sovereign Magiſtrate, and of Chriſtian Subjects worſhiping God ordinarily in true particular paſtoral Churches, over which the foreſaid Magiſtrate excerciſes a <hi>coercive</hi> Government <hi>by the Sword,</hi> as Paſtors exerciſe a <hi>Miniſterial</hi> one <hi>by the Word.</hi> I do alſo judg <hi>Claſſical, Provincial,</hi> and <hi>National Synods</hi> to be, ſo far from being an <hi>human Invention</hi> in the common ſenſe of the Word, <hi>i. e.</hi> a ſinful or ſuperſtitious Invention of Men, that I think 'em highly agreable <hi>to the Light of Nature</hi> and the <hi>general Rules of Scripture,</hi> and have in the <hi>Reflections</hi> poſitively aſſerted <hi>that particular Churches are oblig'd to endeavour the preſervation of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Concord, by the amicable conſultations of their aſſociated Paſtors.</hi> I do not therefore <hi>think any particular Church to be ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent,</hi> as to be under no obligation to enter into ſuch aſſociations but the contrary. And to give him the true Account of this matter what I have aſſerted in thoſe <hi>Reflections,</hi> is but the common Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples wherein both the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> and <hi>Congregational</hi> Divines are agreed, as he may ſee if he compare thoſe Paſſages I have quoted, with the <hi>Heads of Agreement</hi> between 'em ſince drawn up. For in the 6th. Head, there are theſe Three particulars lay'd down.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:134578:81"/>1. That in order to concord, <hi>and in any other weighty and difficult Caſes, it is needful, and according to the mind of Chriſt, that the Miniſters of ſeveral Churches be conſulted and adviſed with about ſuch matters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That ſuch Meetings may conſiſt of ſmaller or greater Numbers, as the matter ſhall require.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>That particular Churches, their reſpective Elders and Members, ought to have a Reverential regard to their Judgment ſo given, and not diſſent therefrom without apparent grounds from the Word of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are <hi>Propoſitions</hi> of the ſame import with thoſe in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections,</hi> and they are ſo far from being inconſiſtent with any <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of thoſe call'd <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> that the moſt eminent of thoſe at <hi>London,</hi> have ſubſcrib'd 'em. 'Tis true indeed, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> do aſſert more then this, and the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of <hi>Divines</hi> in their <hi>humble Advice concerning Church Government</hi> have ſome Aſſertions, to which the <hi>Congregational Divines</hi> do not fully aſſent: But as to theſe <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,</hi> as I have not in the foremention'd Book declar'd my own Judgment, ſo I know no right the Biſhop has to declare it for me, when he dos not know it. I have indeed quoted the Judgment of Archbiſhop <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> concerning the <hi>Antient Councils,</hi> which he thought were not for <hi>Government</hi> but <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity, &amp;c.</hi> And if he will on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count rank that Venerable <hi>Primate</hi> among the <hi>Congregational Divines,</hi> they will no doubt think themſelves greatly honour'd with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. But for my own Thoughts, I ſhall freely ſubjoin, that I am greatly inclin'd to think, That the difference between thoſe that make <hi>Synods,</hi> only <hi>Conſultative Meetings,</hi> and thoſe that call 'em <hi>Church Judicatories,</hi> and aſcribe a <hi>Governing Power</hi> to 'em, is in a great meaſure rather verbal then real. For thoſe that make 'em <hi>Church-Judicatories,</hi> aſſign 'em only a <hi>Miniſterial</hi> and <hi>Declarative Power,</hi> and never imagin'd that the People ow'd a blind obedience to their determinations. And thoſe that make 'em only <hi>Conſultative Meetings</hi>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:134578:82"/> for preſervation of Concord, yet aſſert ſuch a deference due to their Judgment, <hi>That it ſhou'd be complied with, both by particular Paſtors, and their Flocks, in all things not repugnant to the Word of God:</hi> Nor do they deny that ſuch <hi>Synods</hi> may diſown ſuch particular Paſtors and their Flocks, as walk diſorderly, by rejecting their juſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Determinations, as no Members of their Aſſociation, or that they may entirely diſclaim Chriſtian Communion with thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches that perſiſt impenitently in maintaining ſuch corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Doctrine and Worſhip, as directly ſtrike at the very Vitals and Eſſentials of the Chriſtian Religion. And I ſee not what thoſe can juſtly attribute to ſuch <hi>Synods</hi> more then this, who make 'em <hi>Governing Aſſemblies,</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Judicatories.</hi> Nor do I know any great difficulty there is in moderate and wiſe men's joining in all the real uſe of ſuch <hi>Synods,</hi> in order to the preſervation of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches peace; notwithſtanding theſe different Names or Notions they affix to ſuch <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Aſſemblies</hi> and their <hi>Determinations:</hi> Of which more may occur when I conſider what his Lp. objects againſt the <hi>Principles</hi> he aſcribes to me.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, The Biſhop has not truly ſtated the difference between the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Prelatiſts,</hi> when he tells us; <hi>'Tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe particular Diſtricts; namely, Whether the government over 'em ought to be in a Presbytery, with a Biſhop as Preſident and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, by Chriſt's appointment, or in a Colledg of Presbyters abſolutely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. Dos not his Lordſhip know, that our Modern <hi>Prelates</hi> not only pretend to a <hi>diſtinct and ſuperior Office,</hi> (and not meerly a <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er degree</hi> in the ſame <hi>Office</hi>) but aſſume all <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction</hi> to themſelves? Do they not plainly exclude all <hi>Presbyters</hi> from any ſhare in it? Are not all <hi>Church Cenſures</hi> paſt by the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> ſolely in the <hi>Biſhop's name,</hi> without any concurrence of the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> who have no <hi>voice</hi> in 'em, nor are ſo much as <hi>call'd</hi> or <hi>requir'd</hi> to be preſent in the <hi>Spiritual Court?</hi> Nay If this be all that our <hi>Prelates</hi> pretend to, viz. <hi>To be Preſidents in a Dioceſan Synod, in which the Presbyters of the Dioceſs ſhare in the Government,</hi> How came they to reject Archbp. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher's model of Epiſcopacy,</hi> that allows
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:134578:82"/> ſuch a ſtated <hi>Preſidency</hi> to <hi>Biſhops,</hi> when this was offer'd by the <hi>Divines</hi> call'd <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> at the memorable <hi>Savoy Conference,</hi> as the ground of Accomodation? For tho thoſe <hi>Divines</hi> did not think ſuch a ſtated <hi>Preſidency</hi> of one <hi>Perſon</hi> of immediate <hi>Divine Appointment,</hi> yet they thought it ſuch a <hi>prudential human Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> as they cou'd for peace ſake ſubmit to. But he knows the <hi>Biſhops</hi> rejected that Offer with ſcorn, nay wou'd not ſtand to the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Declaration about Eccleſiaſtical Affairs,</hi> that gave 'em much more of power then Archbp. <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſhers model.</hi> So that his Lp. ſeems not to underſtand the <hi>Principles</hi> of his <hi>Brethern,</hi> and I am beginning to hope is of more moderate Sentiments in this point then thoſe <hi>Commiſſioners</hi> at that <hi>Treaty</hi> were.</p>
               <p>It remains only under this <hi>Head,</hi> that I conſider what he has to object againſt thoſe <hi>Principles</hi> of mine, as they are now truly cited from the <hi>Reflections.</hi> For I hope he dos not think me oblig'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend <hi>Poſitions</hi> that are none of my own.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Now it is manifeſt <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> That theſe Principles of theirs-are much more different from your Principles then ours are: And the difference is much greater and more material. For it's poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on your Principles and ours to preſerve <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and keep up ſome value for <hi>Excommunication,</hi> ſince he who is cenſur'd in one Church, cannot be received in another, neither with you, nor us, Whereas in the Congregational way, he that is Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated in one <hi>Congregation</hi> may remove to another, or ſet up one for himſelf, if he pleaſes; At the worſt if he ſhou'd, it wou'd be counted but an irregularity. Theſe Principles are deſtructive to the Peace and Unity of the Church, as well as to our common Cauſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. For the <hi>Congregational</hi> Divines I ſee no difficulty in clearing their Principles from theſe invidious conſequences he draws from 'em; for all of 'em aſſert that he who is juſtly Excommunicated in one Church ought to be receiv'd by no other whatever. But for my
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:134578:83"/> 
                  <hi>own,</hi> which I am only here concern'd to defend, I wou'd deſire his Lp. to review his Arguments and tell me where the force of 'em lyes, What <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of the Church are thoſe <hi>Principles</hi> lay'd down in the <hi>Reflections</hi> deſtructive of? Is it deſtructive to the Churches <hi>Unity</hi> to aſſert, <hi>That the Light of Nature and general Rules of Scripture oblige the Paſtors of the Church to aſſociate for it's preſervation by their mutual Conſultations; And that the Judgment of ſuch aſſociated Paſtors ſhou'd be ſubmitted to whenever 'tis not repugnant to the Word of God?</hi> Nor do I diſallow, but approve of <hi>Aſſociations</hi> in thoſe <hi>leſſer</hi> or <hi>larger</hi> Diſtricts, and the regular <hi>Subordination</hi> of the <hi>leſſer</hi> to the <hi>greater.</hi> What then can he find in my <hi>Principles</hi> deſtructive of the Churches <hi>Unity,</hi> unleſs he imagines it to be ſo, That I aſſert, <hi>That the People do not owe a blind Obedience to ſuch Synods, and that ſuch aſſociated Paſtors have their power for Edification and not Deſtruction.</hi> And dare he pretend the contrary? Dos not the <hi>Church of England</hi> declare, <hi>That all Councills may err,</hi> and will he aſſign an abſolute Authority in the Church to thoſe that are but <hi>fallible?</hi> Nay is not the pretence of the People's being <hi>abſolutely oblig'd</hi> to receive and ſubmit to the Deciſions of General <hi>Synods,</hi> the very foundation of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the chief ſource of all thoſe monſtrous corruptions in Doctrine and Worſhip which have been eſtabliſh't in it by the pretended deciſive Authority of ſuch <hi>Councills?</hi> Have not all thoſe <hi>Councills</hi> that have claim'd ſuch unlimited Authority been the fatal Engines of <hi>Tearing</hi> and <hi>corrupting</hi> the Chriſtian Church inſtead of preſerving it's <hi>Purity</hi> or <hi>Peace?</hi> As he may ſee prov'd with uncontrolable Evidence in Mr. <hi>Baxters Hiſtory of Bp's and their Councills and in the defence of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, How do theſe <hi>Principles</hi> of mine <hi>hinder the keeping up a juſt value for Excommunication or any other cenſures of the Church?</hi> For it no way follows from 'em <hi>That he who is cenſur'd in one Church may remove to another, or ſet up one for himſelf if he pleaſes.</hi> For he that is juſtly <hi>cenſur'd</hi> in one Church, ſhou'd not be receiv'd by any other whatſoever; And where the Paſtors of particular Churches are <hi>aſſociated,</hi> as I ſuppoſe they ought to be, this is always one neceſſary <hi>Rule</hi> for the preſervation of <hi>Unity.</hi> 'Tis true, If the perſon Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:134578:83"/> complain of wrong done him, he may refer his Caſe to the Judgment of the <hi>Claſſical</hi> or <hi>Provincial Synod</hi> for redreſs of it. But, if it appear that he is juſtly Excommunicated; For any other Paſtor to receive him, 'tis ſuch an irregular practiſe, as if perſiſted in may juſtify his Brethren in excluding him from being a Member of their <hi>Aſſociation.</hi> And for a juſtly Excommunicated Perſon to <hi>ſet up a Congregation for himſelf,</hi> is ſo hainous an Addition to the crime for which he was Excommunicated, that ſuch aſſociated Paſtors may juſtly warn the People againſt the danger of encouraging him in ſo impudent an Uſurpation of <hi>Authority</hi> in the Church, when he is not fit to be ſo much as a <hi>Member</hi> in it. Nor wou'd this <hi>Uſurpation</hi> of the ſacred Office by ſuch a juſtly Excommunicated Perſon be only an <hi>irregularity</hi> (if he means by that a diſorder that's culpable indeed, but yet tolerable, and inconſiderable.) For he is incapable of the Sacred Office, becauſe deſtitute of the qualifications neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>So that upon the whole the <hi>Biſhop</hi> is groſly miſtaken in ſuppoſing that any <hi>Principles</hi> of mine are more different from thoſe of the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> then thoſe of the <hi>Prelatiſts</hi> are. For I have aſſerted none but what any <hi>Presbyterian</hi> will grant; tho they may aſſert more then my Subject then led me to: Whereas the <hi>Principles</hi> of thoſe <hi>Prelatiſts,</hi> that approve our preſent <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> are not only very different from <hi>theirs,</hi> but truly <hi>leſſen the value of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>render Church Diſcipline impracticable.</hi> For what can more effectually <hi>pour Contempt on the Cenſures of the Church,</hi> then to have the moſt ſolemn of 'em, I mean <hi>Excommunication,</hi> decreed by a <hi>Lay-Chancellor,</hi> and what is worſe decreed uſually upon ſo frivolous cauſes, in ſo raſh and precipitant a manner, and made meerly an engine to ſqueeze the purſes of men, rather then reform their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. And what can more effectually <hi>render true Church Diſcipline impracticable</hi> then for one man to engroſs the whole exerciſe of it in a large Dioceſs, containing many ſcore or hundred Churches, (whereas every Paſtor finds it a work hard enough to perform it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:134578:84"/> in his ſingle Congregation) and to exclude thoſe particular Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors entirely from it, to whoſe office it dos belong and without whoſe concurrence it can never be rightly adminiſtred.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only add, That what any Conforming Divines have wrote, in <hi>anſwer</hi> to any <hi>Principles</hi> of mine, I know not. And for ſuch Books as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> has wrote in defence of the Non Conformiſt's Cauſe, ſuch as his <hi>Non-Conformity ſtated and argued,</hi> and his <hi>Treatiſe of Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy.</hi> If he think 'em <hi>carefully anſwer'd,</hi> I wiſh he would direct us to the <hi>Anſwerers:</hi> For I know of no ſuch <hi>Anſwerers,</hi> unleſs he take <hi>railing</hi> or <hi>nibling</hi> at Books to be <hi>anſwering</hi> 'em. But if he refers to the Debates between Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> and to the <hi>vindication</hi> of the latter againſt M. <hi>Humfrey's</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> he may eaſily ſee how little that <hi>vindication</hi> ſignifies in the <hi>firſt part</hi> of Mr. <hi>Baxter's Catholique Communion,</hi> which is a <hi>ſurvey</hi> of the <hi>Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And by the way, that judicious Divine was ſo far from enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Principles ſo deſtructive to thoſe of the Northern <hi>Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> (as the Biſhop here groundleſsly imagines) that he commends thoſe in <hi>Scotland</hi> for their <hi>National Church-confederacy,</hi> and the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py concord produc't by it. <hi>Nation. Churches p.</hi> 5.</p>
               <p n="6">6. For his laſt Requeſt to the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Miniſters of his <hi>Dioceſs, That they wou'd concur with him in beating down ſuch Vices and Immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities as are oppoſite to our common Chriſtianity; ſuch as Adultery, Fornication, Blaſphemy, Profanatian of the Lord's day, &amp;c.</hi> I doubt not he'll find their moſt ready complyance, and have both their <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>hands</hi> to concur with him in ſo neceſſary a work. And I may I think venture to aſſure him, they will receive no Perſons <hi>Excommunicated</hi> for ſuch <hi>Vices</hi> into their Congregations, nor give 'em the leaſt countenance. But I hope his Lordſhip will not reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe guilty of <hi>Fornication</hi> who are Married by Non-Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt-Miniſters upon due publication of the Banes of Matrimony, nor expect that they ſhou'd reject their own Members, when the <hi>Spiritul Courts</hi> for want of other prey, on that ſcore draw 'em into
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:134578:84" rendition="simple:additions"/> their Churches, and bring 'em under their Laſh, Nay as they have very little hope of any great <hi>Reformation of manners,</hi> from either the <hi>Perſons</hi> that compoſe thoſe Courts, or their <hi>manner</hi> of proceeding in 'em, both which they think greatly need to be reform'd, ſo I hope his Lordſhip dos not expect that they ſhou'd turn Informers to <hi>bring Griſt to their Mill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if complying thus far with his Lordſhip's foremention'd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts will contribute ſo much to his living more eaſily with the Diſſenters, and to the taking off that uncharitableneſs which the differences that remain are apt to cauſe, I hope thoſe of his Dioceſs will herein give him all the reaſonable Satisfaction he can deſire, And then I hope his Lordſhip will not continue the feud on his part, by putting ſuch uncharitable Sour Covenants into his new Leaſes, as plainly imply his Intentions and endeavours to expel them, and ſuppreſs their meetings wherever his power and Intereſt can reach. For otherwiſe he will give 'em too great occaſion to apply to theſe obliging expreſſions when compar'd with his Actions, that unhappy Remark, <hi>The voyce is the voyce of Jacob, but the hands (thoſe rough and hairy ones) are the hands of Eſau.</hi>

                  <hi>III.</hi> For his Lordship's <hi>Advice</hi> to the <hi>Conforming Laity</hi> of <hi>Derry.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Shall take no farther notice of it, then to expreſs my great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In his recommending to 'em the Worſhip of God in their Familys.</hi> The general neglect of this has been one great ſource of the deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degeneracy and corruption of our Youth. And I heartily wiſh the <hi>Clergy</hi> were herein more exemplary to the <hi>Laity,</hi> by making their Houſes leſſer Churches and fruitful Seminarys of Religion. I hope the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> of that Dioceſs, as well as in other parts of the Kingdom, ſet 'em herein a Pattern worthy their imitation. But why his Lordſhip ſhou'd in their Family-Prayers ſeem to confine 'em to the words of the Church, I ſee no reaſon; unleſs he ſuppoſes thoſe <hi>Forms</hi> ſuch a Catholicon in <hi>Devotion,</hi> as ſome boaſt their <hi>Recipe's</hi> to be in Phyſick, that will ſuit all <hi>particular Diſeaſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>In his exhorting 'em not only to Innocency of life but to Chriſtian moderation too.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For certainly when our Zeal, inſtead of being lay'd out to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the great and important Intereſts of our common Chriſtianity, is chiefly ſpent about leſſer matters diſputable among truly good men, It turns into a praeternatural and <hi>feavouriſh heat</hi> that <hi>preys</hi> on the <hi>Vitals</hi> of Religion. But I muſt add, That I underſtand not, Why <hi>Innocency of Life and moderation</hi> in the <hi>Conforming Laity,</hi> ſhou'd any more convince the Non Conformiſts of the <hi>unreaſonableneſs of ſeperation from them,</hi> then the like <hi>Innocency and moderation</hi> of the <hi>Non Conformiſts</hi> ſhou'd convince their <hi>Conforming</hi> brethren of the <hi>unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of ſeperation from them.</hi> And no doubt but all good men on both ſides enjoy that <hi>Communion of Saints</hi> which our Creed ſpeaks of; And where their difference of Judgment about ſome modes of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:134578:85"/> Worſhip unavoydably occaſions that difference of Practiſe (which ſome improperly call <hi>difference of Communion</hi>) yet there is no reaſon it ſhou'd diſunite their Affections. They retain <hi>Communion</hi> in the Eſſentials of <hi>Belief, Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Holineſs</hi> and are cemented by thoſe common bands of Chriſtian Unity mentioned, 4. Eph. 4, 5, 6. <hi>(One Body, one Spirit, one Hope of their Calling, one Lord, one Faith, one Baptiſm, one God and Father);</hi> And ſo far as they are acted by the genuine Spirit of Chriſtianity they will endeavour to preſerve <hi>this Unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> by mutual <hi>Forbearance</hi> as to that <hi>diverſity</hi> of external <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Modes,</hi> about which it cannot be Expected but that the different <hi>apprehenſions</hi> of pious men will occaſion <hi>diverſity</hi> in their <hi>practiſe,</hi> eſpecially where any <hi>unneceſſary</hi> or <hi>ſuſpected Rites</hi> are <hi>impoſed.</hi>

                  <hi>IV.</hi> For his <hi>Advice</hi> to the <hi>Diſſenting Laity</hi> of <hi>Derry.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Shall only offer the following Remarks,</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Lp. dos well to refer 'em to their <hi>Bibles</hi> as I have alſo done in this Diſcourſe, and I hope they will herein imitate thoſe noble <hi>Beraeans</hi> by examining what is ſaid according to that unerring Standard and Teſt of Divine Truth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That <hi>Men are more fond of their own Inventions then of God's Commands</hi> is a Truth that Experience puts out of all doubt.</p>
               <p>But that all thoſe Popiſh Corruptions of <hi>Image Worſhip, Prayers for the dead, Purgatory,</hi> the <hi>Interceſſion of Saints, Half Comunion, and Worſhipping the Hoſt,</hi> were meerly, introduc't by the violent fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the People for 'em, againſt the will of the Church Governours who generally oppoſ'd and condemn'd 'em, is an <hi>Obſervation</hi> that I can ſee little ground for in <hi>Church-Hiſtory.</hi> As to ſome of 'em, I think it far more probable that they had their riſe either from the imprudent Zeal, or the politick Contrivance of the <hi>Clergy</hi> who
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:134578:86"/> found 'em Serviceable to ſqueeze the Purſes as well as enſlave the Conſciences of the People. 'Tis certain that when thoſe corruptions were once entertain'd, the <hi>Clergy</hi> were generally the moſt violent defenders of 'em, and the moſt cruel perſecutors of all that made any Attempts towards Reformation.</p>
               <p>But the Bp. applys this <hi>Obſervation</hi> to <hi>Extemporary Prayers,</hi> which as he ſuppoſes to be an <hi>human Invention,</hi> ſo he tells us. <q>The People have brought 'em into practiſe againſt the Opinion and Conſtitution of the Church Covernours, and of the firſt Reformers, who all did ſettle Liturgys in the Churches which they reform'd; This <hi>Knox</hi> did in <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe Liturgy we have ready to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the Conviction of thoſe who pretend to be his Succeſſors, and yet condemn Forms of Prayer as unlawful. This <hi>Luther</hi> did for <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> for <hi>Geneva,</hi> and for the <hi>French-Church,</hi> whoſe <hi>Liturgys</hi> are ſtill us'd by 'em.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. I hope I have already ſufficiently prov'd, That <hi>Praying without Forms</hi> is as much of Divine Inſtitution as <hi>Praying with 'em,</hi> and conſequently the Biſhop has no more reaſon to call the one a <hi>Human Invention</hi> then the other. Nay, ſince there is not the leaſt evidence of any ſtinted <hi>Liturgy</hi> preſcrib'd or recommended to the Chriſtian Church by Chriſt or his Apoſtles, but ſo ſtrong preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the contrary; that in the Apoſtolical, and I may add in the two or three following Ages, even ordinary Paſtors us'd <hi>free-prayer,</hi> or prayed in the exerciſe of their own Abilities; There is much more reaſon to rank ſuch ſtinted <hi>Liturgies</hi> among the Biſhop's ſort of <hi>Human Inventions.</hi> For they have certainly neither <hi>precept</hi> nor <hi>pattern</hi> for 'em in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> as us'd in the Chriſtian Church, and we do in the uſe of 'em vary from <hi>Apoſtolical pattern.</hi> And I take this account he has given us of the <hi>Original</hi> of what he calls <hi>Extempore-Prayers</hi> to be a very lame and untrue one. For if <hi>free-prayer,</hi> unconfin'd to a <hi>ſtinted Liturgy</hi> was the practice of the three firſt <hi>Centuries,</hi> (and Dr. <hi>Comber's</hi> proofs to the contrary are I think invalidated by his modeſt and learned <hi>Examinator</hi> to the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:134578:86"/> full ſatisfaction of an unprejudic'd Reader.) Then the <hi>Bp.</hi> is firſt concerned to acquaint us how ſuch <hi>ſtinted Liturgies</hi> were brought into general uſe; And if he will take the Opinion of the learned <hi>Capellus</hi> in this matter, (even in that very <hi>Diſputation</hi> in which he ſo ſeverely cenſures the Compilers of the <hi>Directory</hi>) preſcribed Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgies were unknown to the Apoſtolical and ſucceeding Ages, and were not introduc'd till thoſe Perſecutions ceas'd which kept alive the Zeal of the Primitive Chriſtians, and till through the favour of <hi>Chriſtian Emperors,</hi> the Number of Chriſtians <hi>Encreas'd,</hi> but the Fervour of true Piety and Devotion was <hi>Allay'd.</hi> And then they were gradually introduc'd for the uſe of <hi>ſimple and unlearned Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;</hi> who through their <hi>Sloth</hi> were unfurniſh'd with Gifts, and through their <hi>Ignorance</hi> in danger of venting ſuch unſound Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as ſubtile Hereticks might inſtill into 'em.<note n="†" place="margin">See Theſ. Sal. p. <hi>657.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>But it was much later before ſtinted Liturgies came into general uſe, even in thoſe Ages (the Fifth, Sixth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) in which the Clergy gradually degenerated into <hi>Lazineſs</hi> and <hi>Ignorance,</hi> as well as <hi>Worldlineſs</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi> and true <hi>Devotion</hi> ſunk into <hi>Formality</hi> and <hi>Superſtition.</hi> And hereby the ruling part of the Clergy had the eaſier opportunity to propagate all their gainful Errors and Superſtitions among the People, by infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the poyſon of 'em into the Publick <hi>Offices of Devotion.</hi> For ſuch preſcribed <hi>Liturgies</hi> were firſt ſet up in <hi>Patriarchal</hi> and <hi>Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi> Churches, ſuch as <hi>Rome, Alexandria, Antioch, Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp;c.</hi> And there was very great diverſity of 'em in the <hi>Weſtern,</hi> as well as <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches, for ſome Ages, till by the Artifices and Tyranny of the <hi>Popes,</hi> all or moſt of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Churches were reduc'd to a Conformity herein to that of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe Publick <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> had frequent <hi>Additions</hi> to 'em, and <hi>Changes</hi> in 'em.</p>
               <p>And therefore 'tis no wonder that when our firſt <hi>Reformers</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to oppoſe the Corruptions of <hi>Popery,</hi> they ſhould yet retain the uſe of <hi>Liturgies.</hi> For the <hi>Clergy</hi> were at that time ſo generally over-ſpread with deplorable <hi>Ignorance,</hi> that it was not to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted that thoſe of 'em that embrac'd the Reformation ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately qualify'd to <hi>pray without Forms,</hi> to which they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:134578:87"/> been accuſtomed. They were ſo far from being capable of that, that they were judged generally unfit to inſtruct the People, and therefore <hi>Homilies</hi> were compoſed for their uſe as well as <hi>Liturgies.</hi> But as when by the Revival and Increaſe of Learning, the <hi>Clergy</hi> generally acquir'd better Abilities, and ſo <hi>Homilies</hi> were gradually laid aſide, (the <hi>ſtrong</hi> having no more need of ſuch <hi>Crutches</hi>) ſo the ſame might have been expected in reference to <hi>Prayer</hi> as well as <hi>Preaching.</hi> And accordingly the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> did gradually revive the practice of <hi>praying without a ſtinted Liturgy.</hi> And thoſe in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> that retain ſome few ſhort <hi>Forms,</hi> yet leave their 2Miniſters at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to exerciſe their Gifts in <hi>free-occaſional-Prayer,</hi> and look on ſuch ſtinted <hi>Liturgies</hi> as exclude this Exerciſe of the Miniſters Abilities as too great an Encouragement to <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> in 'em. Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the foreſaid <hi>Capellus,</hi> when upon the like miſtake with our Author, he ſo ſharply chides the <hi>N. C</hi>'s in <hi>England,</hi> for condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Forms of Prayer as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful,</hi> yet does he warmly cenſure the rigour of ſuch as under pretence of certain and preſcribed Forms of <hi>Liturgies,</hi> ſtudy to baniſh out of the Church all uſe of <hi>Prayers</hi> conceived by particular <hi>Miniſters Themſelves,</hi> and diſowns this from being his Deſign.</p>
               <p>So that the main Reaſon why our firſt Reformers retain'd <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi> does not extend to ſuch a ſtate of the Church wherein the Learning and Abilities of Miniſters are or ſhould be ſo improv'd as to ſet 'em as much above the need of ſtinted <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Prayer,</hi> as of <hi>Preaching.</hi> And accordingly, thoſe Churches whoſe Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was carried to the greateſt height, did not by any <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> they retain'd (to expreſs their Concord in that Duty) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the uſe of <hi>free-Prayer.</hi> Nor do any <hi>Diſſenters</hi> condemn all publick uſe of <hi>Forms,</hi> but only ſuch as tempts <hi>Miniſters</hi> to a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the <hi>Gift of Prayer,</hi> and hinders 'em from ſuiting all the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies and Occaſions of their Flocks in that part of their <hi>Publick Devotions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s Reaſon why the generality of the People are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pleas'd with <hi>Extemporary Prayers,</hi> than with ſuch Forms, <hi>viz.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:134578:87"/> Becauſe the Novelty of the one gratifies more Men's carnal and itching Ears with a kind of ſenſual delight, and requires leſs pains to ſtrain up their Minds to true Devotion, p.</hi> 184, 185.—'Tis a very <hi>confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> one, wherein there is ſomething of <hi>Truth,</hi> mixt with weak and cenſorious <hi>Miſtakes.</hi> 'Tis <hi>true</hi> indeed, that conſidering the general temper of Mankind, the <hi>Variety</hi> of <hi>Matter,</hi> as well as of <hi>Expreſſion</hi> in <hi>free Prayer,</hi> tends more to <hi>raiſe Mens Devotion,</hi> than the conſtant Repetition of the <hi>ſame Forms.</hi> Nor can the People ſo readily believe that a Miniſter prays from his heart, when he reads a <hi>preſcribed Form,</hi> as when he delivers a <hi>free Prayer,</hi> that is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of his previous meditation. So that in this reſpect <hi>free Prayer</hi> has much the Advantage above <hi>Forms,</hi> that 'tis a greater <hi>Help</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Devotion; which is ſufficient to recommend this mode of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as in general, far preferrable to the other. There is ſomething of Truth in thoſe Expreſſions of Sir <hi>W. C.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Character of a Whig and Tory, p. 20.</note> (tho' perhaps there is too much of the Air of a <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> in 'em) <hi>When a Man qualify'd endu'd with Learning too, and adorn'd with a good Life, breaks out into a warm and well-deliver'd Prayer before a Sermon, it has the appearance of a Divine Rapture; He raiſes and leads the Hearts of the Aſſembly in another manner than the moſt compoſed and beſt ſtudied Forms can do. And the Pray-we's wou'd look like ſo many Statues, or Men of Straw in the Pulpit, compar'd with thoſe who ſpeak with ſo powerful Zeal, that men are tempted to believe Heaven it ſelf has directed their Words to 'em.</hi> But why the <hi>Bp.</hi> ſhould make it a <hi>carnal</hi> temper in the People to deſire the beſt Helps that can be given 'em to excite their Devotions in Prayer, and cure their natural indiſpoſition to that Duty, I cannot conceive. It looks rather like a <hi>carnal</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the <hi>Clergy</hi> to deny 'em this excellent <hi>Help,</hi> to indulge their own Sloth and Eaſe. Nor do I ſee why the People muſt be accus'd of <hi>itching Ears,</hi> becauſe they are prone to be more <hi>dull</hi> under the conſtant Repetition of the ſame <hi>Forms,</hi> than under the Variety of Matter and Expreſſion that occurs in <hi>free Prayer.</hi> He might as well upbraid 'em with <hi>itching Ears</hi> becauſe they wou'd be more <hi>dull</hi> in ſinging, if the ſame <hi>Pſalm</hi> and <hi>Tune</hi> were <hi>conſtantly</hi> uſed,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:134578:88"/> than when <hi>Variety</hi> of both is allow'd 'em; or becauſe they wou'd be more <hi>dull</hi> if the ſame <hi>Homilies</hi> were conſtantly read, than un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that more grateful variety of Inſtructions that <hi>Sermons</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>But I wonder moſt why his Lordſhip ſhou'd in this reſpect <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare free Prayer to Images, and Relicks, and Mediatory Saints,</hi> p. 185. unleſs he fancies that the uſe of <hi>Images, Relicks,</hi> and <hi>Mediatory Saints,</hi> does as much more contribute to raiſe true Devotion in the Worſhip of God, than the ſimplicity of his own Uncorrupted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions; as the uſe of <hi>free Prayer</hi> contributes more to it than <hi>ſtint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Forms.</hi> And if he truly think ſo, the Papiſts are greatly obliged to his Lordſhip, for this favourable Character of the tendency and effects of theſe <hi>Superſtitions.</hi> But if his Lordſhip had duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, that while <hi>free-Prayer</hi> continu'd in the Church, theſe <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions</hi> were unknown in it, and that they were gradually introduc'd in the ſame Ages in which ſtinted <hi>Liturgies</hi> gradually came into ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral uſe, it might have prevented this <hi>invidious</hi> but groundleſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon between the influence of <hi>free Prayer,</hi> and that of thoſe <hi>groſs Corruptions.</hi> I am ſure ſuch ſtinted Forms, when read out of a Book, look more like lifeleſs <hi>Images</hi> of Devotion, than thoſe <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> that are the reſult of the ſerious Meditations and Affections of him that delivers 'em.</p>
               <p>And <hi>if the fondneſs of Ill People for any way of Devotion, be an Argument that 'tis not of God,</hi> (as the <hi>Biſhop</hi> farther inſinuates, p. 185.) I am apt to think it will make much more againſt <hi>ſtinted Liturgies,</hi> than againſt <hi>free Prayer.</hi> For he will hardly be able to perſwade us that the <hi>Debauchee's</hi> of the Age dote on <hi>Extempore Prayers</hi> (as he calls 'em) and that the moſt <hi>ſerious</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> have the ſame violent paſſion for <hi>preſcribed Forms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We muſt beg his Lordſhips pardon, if we cannot eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, <hi>'tis only Conſcience that makes the Conforming Clergy ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally decline Extemporary Prayers.</hi> For if by <hi>Extempore Prayers,</hi>
                  <pb n="165" facs="tcp:134578:88"/> he means ſuch as are <hi>free</hi> and <hi>unconfin'd</hi> to any preſcribed <hi>Forms,</hi> he ſeems himſelf to own, <hi>p.</hi> 54. That there are <hi>ſome occaſions that require it even in publick,</hi> p. 54. and I ſee no ground to doubt but that they are ordinarily more <hi>convenient</hi> then ſet <hi>Forms,</hi> if thoſe Prayers be moſt <hi>convenient</hi> that tend moſt to raiſe true Devotion in the minds of the People.</p>
               <p>But we muſt much more beg his Lp's pardon for not believing what he adds for Confirmation of this account of their diſuſing <hi>free Prayer.</hi> For it ſeems a very ſurprizing Diſcovery that he has made to us, when he tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 186. <hi>'Tis manifeſt that Extemporary Prayers wou'd be much more eaſy to moſt of us, and leſs burthenſom then the ſervice we uſe. You may think otherwiſe, but aſſure your ſelves that you are miſtaken. And I dare appeal to thoſe that have tried both, whether is moſt eaſie. There are ſuch, both amongſt you and us, that have made the experiment. And I dare refer it to 'em to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare on their Conſciences which of the two Services they look on to be the greater burthen to him that performs 'em. Whatever you may think if we wou'd indulg our ſelves, It were no hard matter for the meaneſt of us to paſs an Extemporary Prayer on our Auditory, or turn the heads of our Sermon into one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> We pay a great deference to his Lp's Judgment, but we cannot, without offering great violence to our own underſtandings, bring 'em to aſſent to ſo incredible a <hi>Paradox,</hi> meerly becauſe 'tis de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd with ſo extraordinary an <hi>Air of aſſurance;</hi> much leſs can we entertain that as a <hi>manifeſt</hi> Truth, which to us ſeems ſo contrary to common ſenſe. For we cannot imagine what unſupportable <hi>burthen</hi> it ſhou'd be for a man to read the <hi>Service</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> when he has the <hi>Book</hi> before him; unleſs when he is <hi>pain'd with ſore eyes;</hi> or <hi>terribly hoarſe with a great Cold;</hi> For then it may poſſibly be ſome conſiderable <hi>Trouble</hi> to him. But for a Miniſter to deliver a <hi>free Prayer</hi> in a Publick Aſſembly (And the Bp. knows the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are ſeldom accuſed for theirs being too <hi>ſhort</hi>) requires both ſerious <hi>Meditation</hi> before hand to ſuit it to the occaſion, and to the ſtate of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:134578:89"/> his People, and the <hi>Laborious Exerciſe</hi> of his <hi>Judgment,</hi> his <hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Memory,</hi> which is a real <hi>burthen</hi> and <hi>difficulty</hi> to thoſe that are not by deep Study and frequent Exerciſe habituated to it. Nay tho the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> ſhou'd Pray in that new way his Lp. has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triv'd for 'em, by <hi>patching</hi> together ſeveral pieces of <hi>old Forms</hi> to make a new dreſs of it, yet this wou'd require ſome Exerciſe of their <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Memory,</hi> to <hi>tack</hi> 'em right together, and to repeat 'em without heſitation. And this ſure is not ſo eaſie a matter as what he cannot deny every School-boy to be capable of, <hi>viz.</hi> to turn over the leaves and Read what is uſually in a fair and large Print. His Lp. may if he pleaſe, appeal from common ſenſe to <hi>Experience;</hi> but by all that I have yet convers'd with on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, his aſſertion ſeems as ſtrange to them as it does to us. Nor can I meet with any of theſe <hi>Vertuoſo</hi>'s in Devotion, that pretend upon any <hi>Experiments</hi> they have made, to give their ſuffrage to his <hi>new Obſervation.</hi> We do not indeed doubt of his Lp's Abilities, but he muſt allow us to doubt of thoſe of the body of the inferior <hi>Clergy,</hi> who I fear wou'd think it a ſevere impoſition upon 'em, if their <hi>Dioceſans</hi> ſhou'd oblige 'em to the frequent Exerciſe of their Talents this way. For I have heard ſeveral <hi>Clergy-men</hi> of no mean parts, complain of the unhappy inability for <hi>free Prayer,</hi> that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſuſe had brought upon 'em, and I believe I might herein with much better reaſon appeal to Experience. But ſince his Lp's hand is in for <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> I think he ſhou'd have added one more, <hi>viz. That 'tis manifeſt that 'tis a far greater burden for the Clergy to Read the Homilies of the Church, or other Mens Sermons, than to Preach Sermons of their own;</hi> and I doubt not he may with as much reaſon appeal to the <hi>Experience</hi> of thoſe that have tried both, to atteſt the Truth of it. And if he can make good the Truth of theſe two <hi>Paradoxes,</hi> the <hi>N.C.</hi> Miniſters will hence forward paſs for <hi>lazy Drones,</hi> while the poor Readers of the Church are accounted the trueſt <hi>Labourers.</hi> But to give the latter their due, the moſt of 'em take too much pains for that ſorry <hi>hire</hi> that's allow'd 'em by ſuch of their Brethren as are <hi>laborious</hi> enough to engroſs Church-Livings, but too far conſult their eaſe to make the Duties of their Function any <hi>burthen</hi> to 'em.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, For his Requeſt to the Diſſenting Laiety, <hi>That they wou'd believe he heartily deſires and ſtudies the good of their Souls,</hi> I hope they are willing to gratify him herein as far as rational Charity can allow. Only it wou'd greatly facilitate their <hi>Belief</hi> of it, if they found him more tender of their <hi>good Name</hi> and <hi>juſt Reputation;</hi> And they are ſory to find that notwithſtanding all his profeſſions of good-will, he ſhou'd ſhew ſo little regard to that, not only in a continued Series of unjuſt Accuſations through his whole Book, but eſpecially in the following words, in which he has drawn up a comprehenſive Summary charge, ſufficient to render 'em odious if it be believ'd, but they are confident too apparently groundleſs to gain credit with any that will paſs a Righteous and Impartial Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on theſe matters.</p>
               <p>His Lp's words are. <q>For how is it poſſible that any Man that has a Zeal for the Purity of God's worſhip, ſhou'd not have his Spirit mov'd within him, to ſee a well meaning People ſo ſtrangely miſ-led, as to content themſelves to meet together perhaps for ſome years with a deſign to worſhip God, and yet hardly ever ſee any thing of God's Immediate Appointment in their Meetings? Now to my thoughts this is manifeſtly the caſe of many of you, ſince a Man may frequent ſome Meetings among you for ſome years, and never hear a Prayer, a Pſalm or Chapter, which has been imediately dictated by God, and never be call'd on to bow his knee to God, or ſee either Miniſter or People Addreſs themſelves to him in that humble poſture; Laſtly, never ſee any body offer to Adminiſter, or deſire to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Food of Life in the Lord's Supper. Theſe are me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Reflections to me, who believe that God has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd theſe in his Worſhip; And therefore I hope you will take it in good part that I Endeavour to Reſtore them to you.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> If the Caſe of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> be truly ſuch as the Bp. Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it, His Zeal to recover the Purity of Divine Worſhip among
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:134578:90"/>
'em, is highly commendable; and wou'd deſerve their thankful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments. But if the whole of this heavy Charge be ſo far from being <hi>manifeſtly true,</hi> that 'tis rather <hi>apparently groundleſs and unjuſt;</hi> There will be ſome occaſion to ſuſpect, that his Lordſhips Zeal has more of <hi>heat</hi> then <hi>light</hi> in it, and is but the <hi>Zeal</hi> of a <hi>Party,</hi> that often tranſports Men beyond all bounds of Truth, when 'tis their deſign to render thoſe odious whom they account their Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And whether this charge be not ſo apparently groundleſs and unjuſt will appear upon the Review of it.</p>
               <p>For do the Diſſenters <hi>content themſelves to meet together for ſome years, and yet hardly ever ſee any thing of God's immediate Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among 'em,</hi> when they have every Lords-day <hi>Prayer, Praiſe, Reading,</hi> and <hi>Expounding,</hi> and <hi>Applying</hi> the Word of God, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lords-Supper,</hi> which are all Duties of <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>immediate Appointment?</hi> Or can he tell us of any other parts of Divine Worſhip beſides theſe, that are inſtituted by God? But his Lordſhip perhaps does not ſpeak ſo much of theſe <hi>parts</hi> of Divine worſhip themſelves, as of the <hi>manner</hi> of performing 'em. For when he comes to make good his charge, he tells us, <hi>A Man may frequent your Meeting ſome years, and never hear a Prayer, a Pſalm, or a Chapter which has been immediatly dictated by God &amp;c.</hi> But why does he charge the Diſſenters for never uſing a <hi>Prayer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately dictated by God?</hi> If he ſpeak of <hi>Pſalm Prayers,</hi> what he ſaith is notoriouſly untrue.</p>
               <p>If he ſpeak of <hi>Proſe-Prayers,</hi> why does he make it our Crime to uſe no ſuch <hi>Prayers immediately dictated by God,</hi> when he cannot produce any ſhaddow of proof of any ſuch <hi>Prayers immediatly dictated by God,</hi> for the uſe of the Chriſtian Church, unleſs the <hi>Lords Prayer?</hi> Nor is there any clear Evidence of its being dictated as a <hi>Form</hi> to be uſed in our Publick Aſſemblies: Or does he think their <hi>Collects</hi> any more <hi>immediatly dictated by God,</hi> than our <hi>free Prayers</hi> are? I hope he may from the foregoing Diſcourſe find, that the latter are more agreeable to the <hi>Precepts</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and much more to the <hi>Pattern</hi> of the Apoſtolick Church, than <hi>ſtinted Liturgies.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="461" facs="tcp:134578:90"/>
               <p>Again why dos he tell us, that the Diſſenters may in ſeveral years never hear a <hi>Pſalm immediately dictated by God?</hi> When <hi>Pſalms</hi> are conſtantly ſung in their <hi>Meetings</hi> much more than in the <hi>Pariſh-Churches.</hi> And can he find any other <hi>uſe</hi> of 'em preſcrib'd to the Chriſtian Church? (except that of their being <hi>read for inſtruction,</hi> as they are among us equally with other parts of the <hi>Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>). Or is he ſo weak as to imagin that a <hi>Proſe Verſion</hi> of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> is <hi>immediatly dictated by God,</hi> but a <hi>Metre-verſion</hi> is not; when God has <hi>immediatly dictated</hi> neither, and when the true ſenſe of the original is as much the <hi>word of God,</hi> when in <hi>metre</hi> as when in <hi>proſe?</hi> Again, why ſhou'd he tell us of our not hearing <hi>a Chapter immedialy dictated by God,</hi> when he never <hi>immediatly dictated</hi> any ſuch diviſion of the Scriptures into <hi>Chapters</hi> at all, nay when an <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire portion</hi> of Scripture, and uſually a whole <hi>Chapter,</hi> and ſometimes more, is ſo conſtantly <hi>read</hi> and <hi>expounded,</hi> beſides the <hi>reading</hi> ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parallel Texts to explain and urge ſome doctrine or precept of the Chriſtian Religion? (<hi>i. e.</hi> when the Scriptures are <hi>read</hi> all the ſeveral ways we have any pattern for in the Chriſtian Church?) Again, why dos he make it a Crime that we do not <hi>bow our knees to God,</hi> when we either uſe that poſture, or that other of <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> which is as much a <hi>ſcriptural</hi> poſture, and equally expreſſive of our religious <hi>reverence</hi> in all our immediate addreſſes to God? Again why ſhou'd he accuſe thoſe as <hi>never ſeeing one offering to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter, or deſiring to receive the food of life in the Lord's-Supper,</hi> who (tho they communicate ſeldomer than other <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> yet) ordinarily do it oftner then the <hi>Conforming Laity</hi> in moſt parts of the Kingdom? One wou'd think his Lp. might have ſpar'd 'em the labour of ſo obvious and eaſie an Apology, by forbearing ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations as have not ſo much as an appearance of <hi>Truth</hi> or <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</hi> But if he cannot perceive things that are ſo clear and plain, the Diſſenters will, in requital of his prayer for 'em, bag of G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="462" facs="tcp:134578:91"/> his mind has been ſo much diſturb'd on this occaſion. For now, if he pleaſe, he may clearly ſee the <hi>Diſſenters enjoy already all thoſe divine Appointments which he is ſo ſollicitous to reſtore to 'em,</hi> and (whatever others do) free from any mixture of ſinful <hi>human Inventions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as they thank him for his endeavour to inſtruct 'em, ſo they humbly requeſt he wou'd calmly and impartially conſider what is here offer'd for their neceſſary vindication; Which if he do, they do not deſpair, but it may recover him to a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opinion of his Brethren, and a more charitable temper towards 'em; and may oblige him, as an evidence thereof, not only to retract his former uncharitable <hi>excluſion of 'em from the Catholick Church,</hi> but this ſuper-added injury, in <hi>charging their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with human Inventions,</hi> and ſo frequently <hi>miſrepreſenting</hi> their <hi>opinions</hi> and <hi>practices</hi> contrary to plain evidence, in order to the countenancing that groundleſs Accuſation.

            <p>To the <hi>Remarks</hi> I have already made on the <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s Diſcourſe, I think it neceſſary to ſubjoyn theſe two <hi>Additional</hi> ones.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>THat his Lordſhip has omitted one material part of Divine Worſhip, about the manner of performing which, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt between the Eſtabliſht Church and the Diſſenters dos moſt directly concern this charge of human Inventions in the Worſhip of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For of thoſe two <hi>Sacraments</hi> which are the two parts of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive inſtituted Worſhip peculiar to the Chriſtian Religion, he has only conſider'd that of the <hi>Lord's-Supper,</hi> but has ſaid nothing concerning the other, which is as undoubted a part of Divine Worſhip, and the very Sacrament of our initiation into the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, <hi>viz. Baptiſm.</hi> I confeſs his <hi>prudence</hi> and <hi>foreſight</hi> ſeems very commendable in this wary ſilence and omiſſion. (For 'tis eaſier to anſwer ſuch objections as he himſelf makes for the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> than thoſe they make for themſelves). But I cannot ſo much commend his <hi>candour</hi> and <hi>ingenuity</hi> in it. For he cou'd not be ignorant that here the <hi>Diſsenters</hi> particularly us'd to fix their charge of <hi>human Inventions in the Worſhip of God,</hi> which the Bp. has been ſo far from endeavouring to clear their <hi>way</hi> of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring this Ordinance from, that he has rather furniſht us with an
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:134578:92"/> invincible argument <hi>ad hominem</hi> to make it good. There are two things which the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> object againſt the way of celebrating this part of Divine Worſhip in the Eſtabliſht Church; The <hi>one</hi> is the <hi>uſe of the Croſs as a dedicating ſign;</hi> The <hi>other</hi> is, <hi>the making God-fathers and Godmothers Sponſors for the religious Education of thoſe children whoſe Parents are living, to the excluſion of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now let us examin each of theſe <hi>Practices</hi> by the Bp's own <hi>Principle. Thoſe ways of Worſhip</hi> (ſaith he, p. 3) <hi>are diſpleaſing to God which are not expreſly contain'd in the holy Scriptures, or warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the examples of holy men therein.</hi> But neither of theſe <hi>ways</hi> of celebrating <hi>Baptiſm</hi> can plead any ſuch expreſs <hi>command,</hi> or ſo much as <hi>example</hi> in the holy Scriptures; none that I know of, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo much as pretended to produce either for 'em. So that unleſs the Bp. retract his own <hi>Principle,</hi> he muſt diſcard both theſe practices as <hi>ſinful human Inventions.</hi> But as I lay no great ſtreſs on an argument founded on ſo ambiguous a <hi>Principle,</hi> ſo I ſhall add, That I fear theſe two things will prove <hi>human Inventions,</hi> according to the juſter notion of 'em given in the <hi>Remarks</hi> on the <hi>Introduction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>Croſs in Baptiſm,</hi> I ſee not how it can be clear'd from being a <hi>New human Sacrament.</hi> For there wants nothing but <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Inſtitution</hi> to make it as much a <hi>Sacrament</hi> as <hi>Baptiſm</hi> it ſelf. For what more can be requir'd to the nature of ſuch a <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> in reference to both the parts of it, than to be a <hi>viſible ſign,</hi> whereby <hi>God's promiſe of the bleſſings of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is confirmed to us,</hi> and <hi>we brought under ſolemn obligation to the dutys of it.</hi> For if ſuch an <hi>external ſign</hi> be appointed by <hi>God</hi> for theſe <hi>ends,</hi> 'tis a <hi>Divine Sacrament;</hi> If by <hi>Men,</hi> 'tis a <hi>Human Sacrament,</hi> or a part of poſitive Worſhip of <hi>human Invention.</hi> Now that the <hi>Establ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſht Church</hi> has appointed this viſible ſign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> for both theſe purpoſes I mention'd before, is, I think, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evident from her own expreſs declaration concerning it. For theſe are her words in the 30th <hi>Canon</hi> of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="165" facs="tcp:134578:92"/>
            <p>
               <q>The Holy Ghoſt by the mouth of the Apoſtle did honour the name of the Croſs ſo far, that under it he comprehended not only Chriſt crucified, but the force, effect and merit of his death and paſſion, with all the comforts, fruits and promiſes which we receive or expect thereby. —And afterwards,—the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath retained ſtill the ſign of it in Baptiſm, following therein the Primitive and Apoſtolical Churches, and accounting it a lawful outward Ceremony, and honourable Badg, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Infant is dedicated to the ſervice of him that died on the Croſs,</q> as by the words of the Common-prayer-book may appear. The words in the Service-book, to which the <hi>Canons</hi> refer, are alſo theſe; <q>We receive this child into the Congregation of Chriſt's Flock, and do ſign him with the Sign of the Croſs, in token that he ſhall not be aſham'd to confeſs the Faith of Chriſt crucified, and manfully to fight under his banner againſt Sin, the World, and the Devil, and to continue Chriſt's faithful Souldier and Servant to his lives end.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here is the <hi>Sign of the Croſs</hi> ſet up to repreſent <hi>Chriſt crucified, and all the comforts, fruits and promiſes which we receive or expect as the force, effect and merit of his death and paſsion.</hi> And ſure Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm can repreſent no more to be either <hi>receiv'd</hi> or <hi>expected</hi> by us. 'Tis alſo advanc't as an <hi>honourable Badg, by which the perſon Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd is dedicated to the ſervice of him that died on the Croſs,</hi> and conſequently brought under ſolemn obligation to all the dutys of the New Covenant, <hi>to confeſs the Faith of Chriſt crucified, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to fight under his banner againſt Sin, the World, and the Devil, and to continue Chriſt's faithful Souldier and Servant to his live's end;</hi> And what more peculiar <hi>dutys</hi> of the Covenant of Grace can <hi>Baptiſm</hi> oblige us to?</p>
            <p>Nay, as thoſe <hi>Sacraments</hi> of Divine Inſtitution are intended by their <hi>ſignification</hi> to excite us to our duty by way of moral cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality, or influence, ſo the ſame is aſcrib'd to this Ceremony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>among the reſt appointed by the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church, that 'tis apt to ſtir up the dull mind of man to the remembrance of his duty to God
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:134578:93"/> by ſuch a notable and ſpiritual ſignification, whereby he may be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> See Pref. to the Cerem.</p>
            <p>So that <hi>Croſsing</hi> in <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is as much a <hi>Sacrament</hi> as any thing can be that is not divinely inſtituted, <hi>i. e.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Sacrament</hi> which men have preſum'd to Inſtitute to the <hi>like</hi> purpoſe, and uſe as our Bleſſed Saviour has Inſtituted <hi>Baptiſm</hi> it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Nor do any of thoſe Excuſes I have yet met with, ſignifie any thing to take off this charge.</p>
            <p>We are ſometimes told, <hi>That Baptiſm is perfect without it.</hi> See the 30th Canon.</p>
            <p>Anſw. Not to inſiſt on what might be juſtly ſaid, that the <hi>Canon</hi> enjoyns the uſe of it in <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> And that a great part of the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is continued after the <hi>croſſing</hi> is over, which ſeem to imply the quite contrary to what the <hi>excuſe</hi> inſinuates; I do not ſee that this ſignifies any thing to remove our <hi>Objection.</hi> For <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is perfect without the <hi>Lord's-Supper,</hi> and yet that's a diſtinct <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and ſo will <hi>croſsing</hi> prove no leſs a <hi>human Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> tho it were adminiſtred in publick worſhip at a different time from that of <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> Only it looks the more preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous to joyn it with <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as if we wou'd ſupyly our Lord's defects in that Inſtitution which he has made the initiating ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bol and badg of our Chriſtian Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>We are alſo told, <hi>That the Miniſter Baptizes in the name of Chriſt, but Signs with the Sign of the Croſs in the name of the Church, who by that Rite receives the Infant into the number of her particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar members.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Anſw. I might content my ſelf with replying, That there is no ſuch thing ſuggeſted in the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> nor in the <hi>Canon</hi> that relates to the <hi>Croſs.</hi> The words us'd by the Miniſter when he <hi>croſſes</hi> the child, rather relate to it's being receiv'd into the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Church, <hi>For that's the Congregation of Chriſt's Flock;</hi> nor is there the leaſt ſyllable in the words following, of the perſon Baptized be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſign'd with the ſign of the Croſs,</hi> in <hi>token</hi> of his <hi>being received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:134578:93"/> this National Church.</hi> But I add, 'Tis no way true that the <hi>Croſs</hi> is only us'd as a <hi>rite,</hi> by which the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church</hi> admits the Baptiz'd into the number of her <hi>members;</hi> For the 36th <hi>Canon</hi> expreſly aſſerts it to be <hi>an honourable badg, whereby the perſon Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd is dedicated to the ſervice of him that died on the Croſs,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to the words of the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> which are plain to that purpoſe. And therefore the difficulty ſtill remains, By what Authority the Church can appoint Miniſters in her name to dedicate men to the ſervice of a crucified Saviour, by a <hi>Rite</hi> or <hi>Ceremony</hi> of their <hi>own,</hi> when Chriſt has already appointed <hi>one</hi> of <hi>his own</hi> chooſing for that <hi>end</hi> and <hi>purpoſe?</hi> For if ſhe cou'd, why do we quarrel with the <hi>Roman Church</hi> for adding ſo many new <hi>Sacraments</hi> to thoſe two which Chriſt has Inſtituted already? Nay, why do we blame the <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> for their additional rites, of <hi>oyl,</hi> and <hi>ſalt,</hi> and <hi>ſpittle,</hi> and annexing ſuch ſpiritual ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and uſe to 'em?</p>
            <p>And 'tis yet more inexcuſable to make ſuch a <hi>human Invention</hi> a neceſſary condition of Chriſtian <hi>Communion</hi> in this part of the Worſhip of God. For that is to deny men the benefit of <hi>God's Inſtitution,</hi> to which all credible Profeſſors of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and their poſterity, have a right, by the charter of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lord, becauſe they dare not comply with a meer <hi>human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi> for which there is as little (if not leſs) to be ſaid, than for any of thoſe other rites practis'd by the Roman Church in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of this Ordinance. And for the cuſtom of <hi>Croſsing</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in common converſation, practis'd by the Primitive <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> to diſtinguiſh themſelves from <hi>Infidels,</hi> we ſee not what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence it can afford, for this <hi>Religious</hi> uſe of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> as a dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating ſign in the publick worſhip of God, eſpecially as conjoyn'd with his own, <hi>viz. Baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the <hi>uſe of God-fathers and God-mothers, as excluſive of the Parents publick promiſe of the religious Education of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> there are theſe two objections lye againſt it.</p>

               </q> Now we may ſafely herein appeal to common experience, how few make any more of this than a matter of meer <hi>Ceremony</hi> and <hi>Form.</hi> And alas, how few that ſeriouſly conſider how hard it is
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:134578:94"/> to diſcharge theſe dutys aright for their <hi>own</hi> children, wou'd wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly entangle themſelves in ſuch ſolemn engagements, to do all this for <hi>other men's.</hi> And yet <hi>Parents</hi> muſt have their children excluded from <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> if they cannot prevail with others to enter into ſuch unreaſonable and raſh <hi>Vows,</hi> in which, the moſt only trifle with the Almighty God, and diſſemble with men in ſo aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a tranſaction.</p>
            <p>If indeed either theſe Sponſors were only engag'd <hi>conditionally</hi> to take care of the child's holy education in <hi>caſe</hi> of the Parent's dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or were only made <hi>witneſſes</hi> of the <hi>credibility</hi> of the Parent's profeſſion of Chriſtianity, as ſome wou'd pretend to ſalve the matter, There were ſomething to be ſaid as an excuſe for this practice. But 'tis evident from what I have already quoted, that they enter into a ſolemn promiſe of all the dutys fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd.</p>
            <p>I might have objected farther, that the 14th <hi>Canon</hi> of the Church of <hi>Ireland</hi> forbids the Miniſter <hi>to refuſe or delay to Chriſten any child brought to him on Sundays or Holy-days,</hi> without any exception, whereas he ſhou'd in all reaſon enquire, whether the Parent be a <hi>Profeſſed Chriſtian,</hi> unleſs it be ſuppos'd that the children of <hi>profeſſed Infidels</hi> have a right to this mark of God's Covenant.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The Biſhop has taken no notice of human Inventions in the Diſcipline of the Church, about which he knows the Contest between the Eſtabliſht Church and the Diſſenters chiefly lyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſpeak not here of any <hi>lawful determinations</hi> of <hi>human prudence</hi> that relate to the exerciſe of that <hi>ſacred diſcipline</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, but of <hi>ſinful corruptions</hi> of it, by <hi>inſtituting ſuch new Officers</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> without any <hi>warrant,</hi> as deprive his undoubted <hi>Officers</hi> of part of that Paſtoral power he has inveſted 'em with, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der true Church-government impracticable; and by variety of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> not only unknown to the Scripture, but contrary to the <hi>Rules</hi> there laid down for the preſervation of <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, unity</hi> and <hi>peace</hi> in the Church.

            <p n="1">1. Since, as we humbly conceive, it was the moſt generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Opinion of the firſt Reformers in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>K. Henry the 8th's, K. Edward the 6th's,</hi> and of the <hi>Conforming Divines</hi> in <hi>Q.

We wou'd humbly deſire 'em to uſe their intereſt, that that unhappy Clauſe may be ras't out of the <hi>Preface</hi> to the preſent <hi>Book of Ordination,</hi> in which 'tis ſo peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily aſſerted, <hi>[That 'tis evident to all men diligently reading the H.

Charles the firſt and</hi> 2d), but eſpecially when 'tis a Propoſition at
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:134578:95"/> beſt diſputable, both among learned <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and, as far as we can judg, rather evidently <hi>contrary to the holy Scriptures,</hi> and to the <hi>firſt and pureſt ages of Chriſtianity.</hi> So that we fear that few Miniſters can ſincerely profeſs their <hi>Aſsent</hi> to this Aſſertion, who have taken the pains to make any impartial enquiry into this matter. And we are the more deſirous of having this <hi>Clauſe</hi> ras't out, becauſe this new Opinion of <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> being a diſtinct <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> from <hi>Preſbytery,</hi> is the ground of that unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table practice of the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church,</hi> in requiring <hi>Reordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in all ſuch <hi>at home,</hi> as have been ordained by <hi>Preſbyters, (i. e.</hi> true <hi>Scriptural Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Paſtors</hi>) as a neceſſary <hi>condition</hi> of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted to the exerciſe of their Miniſterial Function, nay in urging <hi>Reordination</hi> too on all the Miniſters of <hi>Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches abroad,</hi> who never had <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhops among 'em. As if all the adminiſtrations of thoſe Eminent Miniſters in <hi>France,</hi> who are now ſo honourable <hi>Confeſſors</hi> in the cauſe of Reformed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, were mere <hi>Nullitys</hi> till <hi>Prelatical</hi> Hands were laid upon 'em.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Since the <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> claim the <hi>Government</hi> of the Church as their <hi>Province,</hi> we humbly wiſh they wou'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to recover the ſpiritual part of their <hi>Authority</hi> out of their <hi>Chancellor's</hi> hands, who have ſo long uſurpt the <hi>keys of ſacred Diſcipline,</hi> and have hitherto ſo ſcandalouſly manag'd 'em, as to bring the ſolemn <hi>cenſures</hi> of the Church into general <hi>contempt.</hi> And no wonder, when they are proſtituted to ſo vile a purpoſe as that of <hi>filthy lucre,</hi> and thereby the <hi>Temple</hi> of God is turn'd into a <hi>Houſe of Merchandize.</hi> We do not ſpeak this againſt the power of the <hi>Spiritual Courts</hi> in thoſe <hi>Civil</hi> Cauſes, or in thoſe <hi>Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical</hi> ones which their <hi>Majeſties</hi> in purſuance of their juſt pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>circa ſacra,</hi> may authorize 'em to determine; but only their aſſuming the cognizance of all caſes of <hi>ſcandal,</hi> ſo far as they ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject men to the <hi>cenſures</hi> of the Church, and being entruſted with the <hi>infliction</hi> of thoſe <hi>cenſures</hi> even in reference to all the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>cauſes</hi> that come before 'em, ſo few of which properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to an <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Judicatory.</hi> For beſides that, we think,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:134578:96"/> That the power of inflicting thoſe cenſures belongs to <hi>Paſtors,</hi> and cannot be delegated by 'em to a <hi>Layman,</hi> it ſeems a certain and unavoidable, tho pernicious conſequence of ſuch <hi>Spiritual Courts</hi> being entruſted with the ſentence of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> to enforce all their <hi>Decrees,</hi> that the moſt <hi>awful judgment on earth</hi> is like (to uſe my Ld <hi>Bacon's</hi> expreſſions) to be made <hi>an ordinary proceſs to lacquey up and down for fees</hi>

            <p n="3">3. We cou'd heartily wiſh that when their Lp's have recover'd their own Authority out of their <hi>Chancellors</hi> hands, they wou'd ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe it in concurrence with the <hi>Presbyters</hi> of their ſeveral <hi>Dioceſes.</hi>

            <p>And herein alſo the foremention'd Bp. <hi>Bedel</hi> ſet 'em an excellent pattern, <hi>Ib. p.</hi> 90. And we hope the Bp of <hi>Derry</hi> will urge 'em to an imitation thereof, ſince he has laid it down as their common Opinion and Judgment, <hi>p</hi> 175. <hi>That the Government of the Church in ſuch diſtricts as thoſe of our Dioceſes, ought to be in a Preſbytery with a Biſhop, as Preſident and Governour by Chriſt's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. We wou'd alſo humbly deſire 'em to reſtore that <hi>Godly diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> which the Common-prayer-book tells us was in the <hi>primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church,</hi> for bringing ſuch as were <hi>convicted of notorious ſin, to

            <p n="5">5. We cou'd wiſh that part of the <hi>Office</hi> for <hi>Viſiting the Sick</hi> might be review'd, which concerns <hi>Abſolution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For ſince there is no other <hi>Abſolution</hi> own'd in the Reformed Churches, but either <hi>publiſhing the conditional offers of pardon in the Goſpel,</hi> or <hi>a miniſterial releaſing thoſe from the Cenſures of the Church, on whom they had been inflicted before.</hi> We think it dos too much countenance the <hi>judicial</hi> power of <hi>Abſolution</hi> claim'd by the <hi>Romiſh Prieſts,</hi> for the Miniſter to <hi>abſolve</hi> the <hi>uncenſur'd</hi> in ſo peremptory terms; <hi>I abſolve thee from all thy ſins, in the name of the Father, &amp;c.</hi> For they ſeem to make the Miniſter paſs a more <hi>poſitive judgment</hi> of the ſick man's <hi>Repentance,</hi> than he is capable to do.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In order to the more effectual exerciſe of that <hi>godly diſcipline</hi> foremention'd, We wou'd earneſtly requeſt that the Pariſh-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters may be reſtor'd to that <hi>Paſtoral</hi> power which Archbiſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> in his <hi>model of Epiſcopacy</hi> ſhews that they were inveſted in according to the former Book of <hi>Ordination;</hi> but of which they ſeem now depriv'd, by the many changes made in the new.<note place="margin">See the Healing Attempt, p. <hi>57, 58, 59,</hi> &amp;c.</note> 'Tis certain they are moſt capable of a <hi>perſonal</hi> inſpection of the lives of their Flock, and conſequently of enquiring into any ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous miſcarriages among 'em, and ſuiting their admonitions to the caſe of ſuch Offenders, and judging whether there be, or be not, a credible profeſſion of Repentance made by 'em.

<pb n="174" facs="tcp:134578:97"/> obviated by the method propos'd in the foremention'd model of AB <hi>Uſher,</hi> which refers the <hi>decreeing</hi> that ſentence to the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Synod</hi> of the Miniſters in that Precinct, or part of the Dioceſs, of which the <hi>Suffragan</hi> or <hi>Chorepiſcopus</hi> is the <hi>Moderator.</hi> In the mean time, we cou'd wiſh that Pariſh-Miniſters were more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually urg'd to obſerve the 20th <hi>Canon,</hi> which charges 'em <hi>not to admit to the holy Cammunion any of their Cure or Flock, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="7">7. They wou'd farther humbly deſire, that ſome more effectual care may be taken for the tryal of thoſe that are to be admitted into <hi>Holy Orders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the 32d <hi>Canon</hi> enjoyns the <hi>Biſhop to examin 'em in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of thoſe Miniſters that ſhall aſsiſt at the Impoſition of hands,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>take care that thoſe Miniſters ſhall examin them;</hi> yet we underſtand this is too often put off to an <hi>Archdeacon,</hi> or one of his <hi>Chaplains,</hi> and at beſt but too <hi>ſuperficially</hi> perform'd. And we humbly conceive the <hi>Canon</hi> it ſelf is very <hi>defective,</hi> in not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending ſuch <hi>particular Tryals</hi> as are fit for ſuch <hi>Candidates</hi> of the Miniſterial Function to undergo in order to their giving a ſufficient ſpecimen of their proficiency in the <hi>ſtudy</hi> of <hi>Divinity,</hi> and in the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the <hi>holy Scriptures.</hi> And herein we wou'd humbly recommend to 'em the excellent method propos'd by the <hi>Weſtminſter-Aſſembly</hi> in their <hi>Propoſitions relating to Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Ordination, viz.</hi> 
               <q>That ſuch Candidates be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd touching their skill in The Original Languages, by Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hebrew and Greek Teſtaments, and rendring ſome por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 'em into Latin. They are to be examin'd alſo, what Authors in Divinity they have read, and trial ſhall be made of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:134578:97"/> their knowledge of the grounds of Religion, and ability to defend the Orthodox Doctrine in 'em againſt all unſound and erroneous Opinions, eſpecially thoſe of the preſent Age; of their skill and ſenſe in the meaning of ſuch places of Scripture as ſhall be propos'd to 'em, in caſes of Conſcience, and in the chronology of the Scripture, and in the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory. They are to expound ſome difficult place of Scripture; they are to frame a diſcourſe in Latin upon ſome common-place or controverſy in Divinity, and maintain a Diſpute upon it; and they are to Preach a practical Sermon before the people, thoſe concern'd in their Ordination being preſent.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>method</hi> is ſo exactly follow'd among the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> that thoſe they <hi>ordain</hi> commonly paſs twice thro theſe Tryals, both when they are <hi>firſt</hi> allow'd to <hi>Preach</hi> as <hi>Candidates,</hi> and at their <hi>Ordination.</hi> And as 'tis the moſt <hi>effectual</hi> that can be propos'd for preventing an <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>inſufficient</hi> Miniſtry, ſo 'tis the more requiſite that the like care ſhou'd be taken in the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church,</hi> where ſo many are tempted to croud into the Sacred Office by the lure of ſecular intereſt; and ſo many Parents, from the proſpect of preferment thruſt thoſe of their Children upon the ſervice of the Church, whom they are at a loſs how to diſpoſe otherwiſe of.</p>
            <p n="8">8. We cou'd heartily deſire ſome more effectual courſe were taken for the <hi>Reformation</hi> of ſuch of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> whoſe ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous lives ſtain the honour of their profeſſion.</p>
            <p>For the infectious examples of ſuch <hi>Clergymen</hi> are far more powerful to ſpread the contagion of wickedneſs and vice among their Flock, than their doctrine to propagate piety and holineſs. And 'tis no wonder, that either the <hi>offerings</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> are <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd</hi> by the people, when they ſee 'em preſented by ſo <hi>unhallow'd</hi> hands, or that they run without reſtraint into all exceſs of Riot, when they do but herein follow their ſpiritual Guides. 'Tis great pitty therefore that the 42d <hi>Canon</hi> which threatens ſuch ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Clergymen with <hi>Eccleſiaſtical cenſures,</hi> is not more faithfully
<pb facs="tcp:134578:98"/> executed. And it ſeems unaccountable, why it ſhou'd not as expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly order the <hi>ſuſpenſion</hi> and <hi>depoſition</hi> of ſuch as are found incorri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, as other <hi>Canons</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> order their <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion</hi> and <hi>depoſition</hi> for no greater faults, than <hi>Omitting the uſe of any form of Prayer, or any other Rite or Ceremony preſcrib'd by the Service-Book,</hi> or <hi>appointing</hi> or <hi>keeping Faſts either in publick</hi> or in private houſes without the Bp's leave. For this is to lay greater ſtreſs on the <hi>Churches Injunctions,</hi> than on <hi>God's commands;</hi> and to puniſh <hi>non-conformity</hi> to the former, more ſtrictly than <hi>diſobedience</hi> to the <hi>latter.</hi> We ſhall only add, that if the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully provided that its Preiſts ſhou'd have no <hi>blemiſh</hi> or <hi>deformity</hi> on their <hi>bodys,</hi> ſure much greater care ſhou'd be taken, that thoſe who ſerve at the Chriſtian <hi>Altar,</hi> ſhou'd not be perſons of <hi>deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> ſouls, and of a <hi>tainted</hi> converſation. And we are heartily glad, that their Majeſties, by their <hi>Royal Commiſſion,</hi> have begun ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary a work in this Kingdom, as the purging the Church from ſuch <hi>ſcandalous</hi> Clergymen, as have too long been the <hi>blemiſhes</hi> of their holy profeſſion, and hope it may extend to all other parts where there is the like neceſſity for it, as there appears to have been in the <hi>Dioceſs</hi> of <hi>Down</hi> and <hi>Connor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. They wou'd alſo earneſtly deſire that ſo groſs a <hi>corruption</hi> as that of <hi>Pluralitys</hi> and <hi>Non-Reſidence</hi> ſo univerſally complain'd of, may be at laſt effectually <hi>reform'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order whereto, they deſire it may be ſeriouſly conſider'd, whether our <hi>Canons</hi> themſelves do not rather <hi>confirm</hi> than <hi>reform</hi> theſe Abuſes. For by the 36th <hi>Canon</hi> every <hi>Maſter of Arts,</hi> that is a <hi>publick and ſufficient Preacher,</hi> is capable of <hi>Pluralitys.</hi> The <hi>Time</hi> which he that enjoys 'em is to <hi>reſide</hi> in each of his <hi>Benefices,</hi> is not determin'd. And by the 41 <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> I find no other <hi>bounds</hi> ſet to the number of <hi>Benefices,</hi> than that they muſt not be more than <hi>thirty miles</hi> aſunder. And tho every ſuch <hi>Bluraliſt</hi> be requir'd to have under him in the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices</hi> where he dos not reſide, a <hi>lawful and ſufficient Preacher;</hi> yet it is both unreaſonable in it ſelf, that ſuch a <hi>ſufficient Preacher</hi>
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:134578:98"/> ſhou'd ſacrifice his painful labours to pamper the avarice and eaſe of another; And 'tis too notorious, that ſuch <hi>Pluraliſts,</hi> for the moſt part, give ſo deſpicable and ſtingy allowance to their poor <hi>Curates,</hi> that it cannot reaſonably be expected, any man of tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable abilitys ſhou'd be contented with it; and ſo to feed the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous humour of ſuch mercenary Paſtors (as the <hi>Council of Trent</hi> it ſelf calls <hi>Pluraliſts</hi>) their Flocks muſt be betrayd, by being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the care of ſuch, whom their ignorance renders the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of their profeſſion, and who indeed are fit for no other ſort of <hi>Preaching,</hi> than this <hi>new</hi> one the Bp. of <hi>Derry</hi> has found out, <hi>viz. The Reading a Chapter out of the Bible.</hi> Nor do we think the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> about the Clergy's <hi>Reſidence</hi> leſs exceptionable. For the 37th <hi>Canon</hi> ſuppoſes ſome perſons to be <hi>Benefic't</hi> that are not allow'd to be <hi>Preachers</hi> (tho, contrary to the ſoreſaid Bp's notion, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd by the Engliſh <hi>Canons,</hi> to <hi>read plainly and aptly, without glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, or adding,</hi> both the <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Homilys</hi>). And of theſe <hi>Incumbents</hi> that are <hi>unlicenſt to Preach,</hi> no more is requir'd, than that they procure Sermons to be <hi>Preach't once a month in their Cures,</hi> and that too, <hi>if the Living will bear it.</hi> And the ſame <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> only requires every <hi>Benefic't</hi> man that is <hi>licenſt,</hi> to provide for the <hi>Benefice</hi> he <hi>reſides</hi> not on, a <hi>Preaching Curat,</hi> on the ſame <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> that the worth of the Benefice will bear it. As if the <hi>ſouls</hi> of the people were of ſo little value, that they muſt rather pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh for lack of knowledg and inſtruction, than ſuch a <hi>Plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt's</hi> avarice be croſt by reſigning the <hi>Benefice</hi> to one that will take care of the people's ſouls, provided he may enjoy the Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the Law has aſſign'd for the encouragement and ſubſiſtence of ſuch a one.</p>

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:134578:99"/> we can judge, there are many things in thoſe Books, which the more judicious and charitable of our <hi>Conforming</hi> Brethren do not heartily <hi>aſſent</hi> and <hi>conſent</hi> to, but wiſh the <hi>alteration</hi> of; And therefore ſuch cannot <hi>make</hi> the ſaid <hi>Declaration</hi> without doing it in in fo lax a ſenſe as too much countenances <hi>Equivocation</hi> in ſuch important matters as theſe are.</p>

            <p>There has been occaſion given already in this Diſcourſe, to take notice of one of 'em, <hi>viz.</hi> the 5th. which <hi>excommunicates ipſo facto</hi> all <hi>that ſhall affirm, or maintain, that there are within this Realm, other Meetings, Aſſemblys, or Congregations, than ſuch as by the Laws of this Land are held and allow'd, which may rightly challenge to themſelves the name of true and lawful Churches.</hi> And ſure they cannot expect we ſhou'd forbear to vindicate our own <hi>Innocence,</hi> to eſcape this unjuſt <hi>cenſure;</hi> or that we ſhou'd voluntarily <hi>condemn</hi> ſo many <hi>Excellent Churches</hi> to avoid the <hi>Condemnation</hi> of this uncharitable <hi>Canon.</hi> But our <hi>Incapacity for communion</hi> with 'em is encreaſt by the 3d <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> which alſo <hi>Excommunicates ipſo facto not only all that ſhall preach, but all that ſhall by other open words declare or ſpeak any thing in derogation, or deſpiſing of the Service Book, or any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein.</hi> For we cannot poſſibly give to our <hi>Brethren</hi> any account of our <hi>diſſent</hi> from 'em either in <hi>writing</hi> or <hi>private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi> without <hi>ſpeaking open words</hi> in <hi>derogation from ſome thing contain'd in the Service-book.</hi> We cannot complain of the uſe of the <hi>Croſs,</hi> or of that ſort of <hi>Sponſors</hi> in <hi>Baptiſm</hi> which the <hi>Service book</hi> requires; nor blame thoſe uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Rubrics</hi> that debar the moſt ſerious Chriſtians from thoſe <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> that do but ſcruple <hi>croſsing, ſponſors,</hi> and <hi>kneeling;</hi> we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not mention any of thoſe numerous defects in the <hi>Liturgy</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the <hi>Exceptions</hi> given in at the <hi>Savoy</hi>-conference, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out coming under the terrible ſentence of this <hi>Canon.</hi> In a word, we muſt either never <hi>ſpeak</hi> our judgment concerning that <hi>Book,</hi> tho our own neceſſary <hi>Vindication</hi> never ſo apparently <hi>require</hi> it; Or if we do, we are as far as the power of that unmerciful <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> can reach, <hi>Excomunicated, i. e.</hi> in the language of the Eſtabliſht Church, in her form of Excommunication, <hi>cut off, as dead members, from the body of Chriſt.</hi> Again, we are <hi>Excommunicated,</hi> if we
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:134578:100"/> 
               <hi>affirm any of the</hi> 39 <hi>Articles to be in any part ſuch as we cannot with a good Conſcience ſubſcribe to,</hi> tho 'tis known we cannot ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to the <hi>Diſciplinary</hi> ones, tho in <hi>England</hi> they have already done it to the <hi>Doctrinal</hi> ones. And that our buſineſs may be yet more effectually done, We are again <hi>excommunicated by the 4th Canon,</hi> if we <hi>affirm, that thoſe who are conſecrated according to the Rites of the Ordination-Book, are not lawfully made, nor ought to be accounted either, Biſhops, or Deacons; (i. e.</hi> If this <hi>Canon</hi> ſpeak of <hi>Scriptural Biſhops</hi> or <hi>Deacons</hi>) For 'tis ſufficiently known, we neither account the Office of a modern <hi>Dioceſan Biſhop,</hi> nor that of a <hi>Deacon</hi> in the ſenſe of the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church,</hi> to be either of 'em of <hi>Divine Inſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we think it moſt reaſonable, that thoſe who ſo often urge us to their <hi>Communion,</hi> ſhou'd remove ſuch inſuperable <hi>Obſtacles</hi> out of our way. And we humbly conceive there is that appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>abſurdity</hi> and <hi>uncharitableneſs</hi> in theſe <hi>Canons,</hi> that will juſtify our deſire of their being <hi>diſcarded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They are in our judgment guilty of an <hi>apparent Abſurdity;</hi> For we are <hi>Excommunicated</hi> by 'em without any other <hi>Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of our fault, than what the <hi>Canons</hi> themſelves give us. Whereas 'tis not meerly the committing an Offence, that juſtly ſubjects men to that terrible cenſure, but perſiſting <hi>impenitently</hi> in it, according to our Bleſſed <hi>Saviour's</hi> known Rule, 18 <hi>Matth.</hi> 15, 16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that the <hi>Church</hi> in theſe <hi>Canons</hi> uſes greater <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity</hi> than our <hi>Lord</hi> himſelf, who in his judgment will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn men meerly for their <hi>ſins,</hi> but for final <hi>obſtinacy</hi> in 'em. And indeed, if theſe <hi>Canons</hi> be juſt, we are bound in conſcience, as knowing our ſelves <hi>Excommunicate,</hi> to abſtain from the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> of the <hi>Eſtabliſht Church,</hi> till we have <hi>revok't theſe Errors,</hi> as the <hi>Canon</hi> calls our Opinion and Judgment in theſe matters. Now we think it very hard for men to be thus peremptorily <hi>cut off</hi> from <hi>Chriſt</hi> without any <hi>perſonal warning,</hi> that might give 'em opportunity to prevent ſo terrible a doom; For this makes
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:134578:100"/> theſe ſpiritual <hi>Canons</hi> more formidable things than thoſe war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Engines, that at leaſt give ſome notice by their <hi>flaſh</hi> before they do <hi>execution.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. They are in our judgment as apparently guilty of <hi>groſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Aſſertions for which we are <hi>Excommunicated</hi> by theſe <hi>Canons,</hi> relate to matters that are diſputable among ſuch as are truly <hi>Orthodox</hi> and <hi>Pious,</hi> nay among <hi>Divines</hi> of eminent <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Judgment.</hi> And conſequently to <hi>excommunicate</hi> men for <hi>declaring</hi> their Opinion <hi>one</hi> way or <hi>other</hi> in theſe matters, is ſo far from being conſiſtent with <hi>Chriſtian Charity,</hi> that 'tis the worſt ſort of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> and plainly tends to confine that Reformed Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity among us to a narrow <hi>Sect</hi> and <hi>Party,</hi> to which all ſober Proteſtants may juſtly lay their <hi>claim,</hi> as their <hi>common Intereſt.</hi> Nay, we think this ſort of rigor, in enforcing all contain'd in theſe three <hi>Books</hi> of human compoſure, (<hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Book of Articles</hi> (incluſive of that of <hi>Homilys, Art.</hi> 35.) that <hi>of Ordination,</hi> and that <hi>of Common-Prayer</hi>) with ſo peremptory <hi>Excommunication</hi> of all that declare their <hi>diſſent</hi> from any thing in 'em, more inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable in one reſpect, than the rigor of the <hi>Councel</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> in their <hi>Anathema's, viz.</hi> that our <hi>convocations</hi> pretend to no ſuch <hi>Infallibility</hi> in their deciſions, as the <hi>Romiſh Councils;</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more of Chriſtian <hi>forbearance</hi> and <hi>charity</hi> might reaſonably have been expected from men conſcious of the common infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of human nature, which cou'd no more ſecure <hi>themſelves</hi> then <hi>us,</hi> fron miſtakes in ſo <hi>dubious</hi> matters as theſe are.</p>
            <p>As to all theſe Requeſts to our <hi>Reverend Brethren,</hi> we ſhall only add, that we hope they will either ſhew us our <hi>Error</hi> in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things to be <hi>coruptions,</hi> which we here beg the <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of, or elſe, that they will not account it <hi>criminal</hi> in us to <hi>reform</hi> 'em amongſt our ſelves, nor urge us to <hi>receive</hi> 'em a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain after we have <hi>caſt 'em out.</hi> For we may well be forgiven, that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:134578:101"/> we are as unwilling to go <hi>backwards,</hi> as ſome ſeem to be to go <hi>forwards</hi> in the deſirable work of <hi>just</hi> and <hi>neceſſary Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, There is only one <hi>Requeſt</hi> more we wou'd offer to our <hi>Reverend Brethren,</hi> wherein we hope we may more confidently aſſure our ſelves of their complyance with us, <hi>viz.</hi> That we may all of us unite our endeavours with greater zeal and earneſtneſs for reviving that power of practical Chriſtianity and Holineſs that is ſo viſibly declining among us; particularly, by labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to promote more of <hi>Cloſet</hi> and <hi>Family</hi>-Religion in thoſe under our care, and to preſerve or reclaim 'em from thoſe hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſins, (ſuch as <hi>ſwearing, profanation of the Lord's-day, Intemper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, uncleanneſs, Pride, Luxury, &amp;c.</hi>) that have again overſpread this Land, and the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Inhabitants of it, notwithſtanding all the calamitys they have ſo lately brought upon us. And we wou'd farther deſire, That as they have greater advantages of acceſs to our <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> than we have, they wou'd uſe all their intereſt and influence to engage 'em to a more vigorous proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that neceſſary work, <hi>the reformation of manners,</hi> by a more ſtrict Execution of the Laws againſt open irreligion and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And we only crave leave to add theſe two reaſons that urge us to this requeſt; <hi>The one is,</hi> that our hearty <hi>concurrence</hi> in advancing theſe undoubted and important intereſts of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lord, wherein we profeſs to be <hi>agreed,</hi> will be the moſt ſuccesful means to <hi>cement</hi> our affections; And when our Zeal is warmly laid out this way, we ſhall find leſs of <hi>Inclination,</hi> as well as <hi>leiſure,</hi> to proſecute our leſſer differences: <hi>The other is,</hi> that there ſeems to be an <hi>extraordinary neceſſity</hi> of our utmoſt efforts to ſave a periſhing People from that ruine that hangs over our heads. For as the heinous ſins that yet appear ſo barefac't and uncontroll'd among us, are greatly aggravated, both by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer terrible <hi>judgments</hi> under which we have ſo deeply ſmarted, and by the ſurprizing <hi>Deliverance</hi> that ſhou'd have oblig'd us to other returns to its bleſſed <hi>Author;</hi> ſo the many late <hi>indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
               <pb n="183" facs="tcp:134578:101"/> of divine anger in our <hi>publick loſſes,</hi> and in the <hi>ill aſpect</hi> of our affairs, plainly tell us, that the Great God is yet purſuing a <hi>Controverſie</hi> againſt us, becauſe we have not anſwer'd his juſt expectations by returning to him. And as theſe renewed <hi>monitary Judgments,</hi> if they ſtill prove ineffectual, preſage a ſtroke of <hi>deſtructive vengeance,</hi> ſo we ſee nothing ſhort of a <hi>National Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Reformation</hi> likely to prevent it, and there appears no probability of that, till both <hi>Magiſtrats</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtations do <hi>reſolutely</hi> engage in the deſign of promoting it, from a deep conviction of its abſolute neceſſity to prevent our <hi>Ruine.</hi>

            <p>UPon the Review of theſe <hi>Remarks,</hi> I thought it neceſſary here to deliver my thoughts more diſtinctly and fully in reference to the following Paſſage then was proper for me to do, in the body of a Plain Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 15, 16. I have aſſerted, <hi>That 'tis probable that the Pſalms of David were compos'd in Metre,</hi> and produc'd to that purpoſe the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of <hi>Joſephus,</hi> to which I might that of <hi>Philo, Origen, Euſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius, St. Hierom</hi> &amp; <hi>Iſidore Hiſpalenſis,</hi> †</p>
            <p>But I wou'd here add in explication of that paſſage, that I do not take <hi>metre</hi> or <hi>verſe</hi> in the ſtrict ſenſe of the words, as if there were the ſame kind of <hi>meaſures</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> that were afterwards in uſe among the Polite <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins;</hi> For tho I know <hi>Gomarus</hi> in his <hi>Lyra Davidica</hi> has attempted to prove that the <hi>Pſalms</hi> were compos'd in <hi>metre</hi> even in this ſtrict ſenſe, and his performance was at firſt greatly applauded by the Elder <hi>Buxtorf, Heinſius L. de Dieu, L'Empereur, Hottinger,</hi> and others, yet <hi>Lud. Capellus</hi> has ſo far blaſted the Credit of it in his <hi>Animadverſions</hi> on it, that the Attempt ſeems given up as by other Learned Men, ſo by <hi>Buxtorf</hi> (the Son) himſelf. But for ſuch <hi>metre</hi> or <hi>meaſures</hi> in the Hebrew <hi>Pſalms</hi> as did accommodate 'em to <hi>Vocal</hi> and <hi>Inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> Muſick, and thereby gave 'em the denomination of <hi>verſe</hi> as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd from meer <hi>proſe,</hi> I ſee no reaſon to doubt of it; And this ſort of <hi>metre</hi> the Bp. has groundleſly confounded with meer <hi>proſe,</hi> in the paſſage the <hi>Remarks</hi> refer to (<hi>Diſc.</hi> p. 8,) from which I ſhall now ſhew it ought to be carefully diſtinguiſh'd.</p>
            <p>And to clear this I ſhall lay down the following Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Poetry</hi> in general was in its firſt riſe vaſtly different from what it was afterwards.</p>

            <p>'Tis ſo in all other <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Inventions,</hi> and no doubt was ſo in this. See what <hi>Voſſius</hi> obſerves to this purpoſe, <hi>de Art. Poet. naturâ p.</hi> 76. when ſpeaking of the <hi>Verſus,</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Bible Poetry</hi> differs vaſtly from that of the more polite <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> (ſuch as <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Virgi'ls</hi> &amp;c.) and of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Europeans</hi> and <hi>Aſians,</hi> nay from the modern <hi>Jewiſhones,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the difference lies chiefly, 1. As to feet of a long or ſhort quantity artificially diſpos'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to a <hi>Stated</hi> and conſtantly equal <hi>number of Syllables.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to both theſe Ingredients of ſtrict <hi>metre</hi> and <hi>verſe,</hi> the moſt learned <hi>Rabbies</hi> do indeed tell us they are not to be generally found in the <hi>Bible Poetry. See to this purpoſe</hi> Coſri, <hi>part</hi> 2 p. 133. 136, 137. <hi>Diſſert. Rabbinicae,</hi> at the end of <hi>Cozri</hi> p. 408. p. 424. See alſo <hi>Pfeiffer</hi>'s <hi>Dub. vex.</hi> p. 545, 546, and 536.</p>
            <p>And indeed tho many learned Authors greatly applaud the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Feet and of (<hi>Rythmus</hi> or) a ſtated number of <hi>Syllables. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially diſpos'd,</hi> as a thing of admirable uſe to excite or allay the Paſſions, and herein think the later Poetry has the advantage of the <hi>Ancient, (See Iſ. Voſſ.</hi> de <hi>Poem. Cantu</hi> &amp; <hi>Viribus Rythmi,</hi> p. 11, 12, 13.) yet on the other hand, the obſervation of 'em dos often <hi>ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> and <hi>cramp</hi> the Poet, that he cannot ſo freely vent himſelf. And tho this inconvenience may be tolerably avoided in more <hi>Copious</hi> Languages, It muſt have been great in ſo <hi>narrow</hi> a one as the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue undoubtedly is.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to <hi>Rhimes</hi> (I ſpeake not here of what the Latins call <hi>Rythmus,</hi> but take the word in the modern ſenſe for the ending of the Verſe in ſyllables of the like found)</p>
            <pb n="187" facs="tcp:134578:103"/>
            <p>Of theſe there are but few in the <hi>Bible Poetry,</hi> and 'tis doubtfull whether de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned or by chance. And the general uſe of theſe is certainly of a much later date then of the tvvo former.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            <p>But others of 'em we are more at a loſs to underſtand, becauſe we have utterly loſt the Ancient Hebrew Muſick, even as to <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> as well as <hi>Tunes:</hi> yea the Ancient <hi>Muſick</hi> of other Nations is loſt. See <hi>Iſ Voſs. de Poem. Cantu,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 21. &amp; 48.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole then, ſinee the Pſalms were wrote in ſuch ſort of <hi>Metre</hi> and <hi>Verſe</hi> as was then us'd; ſince the knowledge of their particular Muſical Tunes and Inſtruments is quite loſt, we cannot be oblig'd to an exact imitation of 'em; for that were to ſuppoſe us oblig'd to Impoſſibilities. The Commands therefore that enjoyn Chriſtian Churches to <hi>ſing Pſalms,</hi> neceſſarily oblige us to turn 'em into ſuch ſort of <hi>Metre</hi> and <hi>Verſe,</hi> as will accommodate e'm beſt to be <hi>ſung</hi> by the People. Whereas to put 'em into no other Metre than the <hi>Pointed Pſalter</hi> in the Common-Prayer-Book, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the generality of the People from any capacity of complying with God's own Command for <hi>Singing</hi> 'em. And as the <hi>Tunes</hi> of thoſe <hi>pointed Pſalms</hi> are quite different from the <hi>Hebrew</hi> ones, ſo they are as much a <hi>human Invention</hi> as the <hi>Tunes</hi> of the common <hi>Metre-Verſions.</hi> And therefore to ſet up that <hi>pointed Pſalter</hi> in the <hi>Service-Book,</hi> whoſe Tunes the body of the People cannot follow, to the Excluſion of thoſe Metre-verſions, according to which they can joyn in ſinging the Pſalms (as the Bp. ſeems to deſign) is in
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:134578:105"/> his Language to ſet up a <hi>human Invention</hi> to the violation of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Command, by rendring the Peoples obſervance of it impra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Bp. adds, <hi>p.</hi> 8. <q>That we cannot find that our Saviour and his Apoſtles in their time, or thoſe in the Age imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately following, ſung any thing in verſe; but we are ſure they ſung Hymns in Proſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only ſubjoyn, That I cannot imagine whence the Bp. ſhou'd be ſure, <hi>That Chriſt and his Apoſtles Sung Hymns in Proſe.</hi> For by the account already given, 'Tis no way probable ſince the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew-Pſalms (tho compos'd when Poetry was but in its firſt riſe and as it were unfledg'd and unform'd) were in <hi>Verſe</hi> as diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd from <hi>Proſe.</hi> Nay that in the Apoſtles time, and in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Ages they <hi>Sung</hi> in <hi>Metre</hi> and <hi>Verſe,</hi> ſeems more probable, from the Relation that <hi>Euſebius</hi> gives us from <hi>Philo</hi> concerning the <hi>Therapeutae</hi> or <hi>Worſhippers</hi> in <hi>Egypt. Philo</hi> flouriſh'd in the middle of the Apoſtolical Age, of whoſe <hi>Commentary Euſebius</hi> tells us, <hi>Eccles. Hiſt. l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 16: <q>That it contain'd manifeſtly the Canons or Rules hitherto conſerved in the Church; and that inſomuch as he <hi>(i. e. Philo)</hi> has curiouſly deſcribed unto us the lives of our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeticks or Religious Men, he plainly ſhews that he not only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, but alſo greatly admir'd and approv'd thoſe Apoſtolical Men; who probably deſcending from the Hebrews, did therefore obſerve the ancient Rites and Ceremonies of the Jews. Now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other cuſtoms of thoſe Therapeutae, <hi>Philo</hi> relates <hi>Eccl. Hiſt. l.</hi> 2 <hi>c.</hi> 17. That they made Songs and Hymns to God in grave and ſacred Rhymes (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) of every kind of Metre and Verſe.</q> 'Tis true indeed that <hi>Scaliger de Emend. Temp. l.</hi> 6. falls foul on <hi>Euſebius</hi> for making theſe <hi>Therapeutoe</hi> or <hi>Worſhippers</hi> to be <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and <hi>Valeſius, Annot. in Euſeb: p:</hi> 34. 35. falls in with him in that, tho he diſſent from him that theſe <hi>Therapeutoe</hi> were <hi>Eſſenes</hi> and pretends to prove the contrary. But the Arguments of <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Valeſius</hi> on both theſe heads, are well anſwer'd in <hi>Bruno's Diſſertatio de Therapeutis,</hi> Printed at the end of <hi>Colomes</hi>'s Edition of the Epiſtle of <hi>Clement ad Corinthios.</hi> But however that bee, 'Tis evident that
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:134578:105"/> 
               <hi>Euſebius</hi> not only aſſerts ſuch Divine <hi>Hymns</hi> compos'd in <hi>Metre</hi> and <hi>Verſe</hi> to be in uſe among Chriſtians in his Age, but to have been a cuſtom deriv'd to 'em from the Apoſtolical Age, and continually preſerved in the Church, as <hi>Philo</hi> ſuppoſes ſuch Hymns to have been uſual among the <hi>Jews.</hi> So that we have better ground to conclude that Chriſt and his Apoſtles and the following Ages ſung Hymns in <hi>Metre</hi> and <hi>Verſe,</hi> then the Bp. has produc'd for their Singing <hi>Hymns in Proſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for the <hi>Alternate ſinging</hi> of the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> Dr. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> acknowledges the truth of what <hi>Theodoret</hi> aſſerts, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 24. That this cuſtom was firſt brought into the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> by <hi>Flavianus</hi> and <hi>Diodorus.</hi> and from thence univerſally ſpread, <hi>of Lit. p.</hi> 87, 88. And Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſaith, That St. <hi>Baſil in the deſcription of a Clergy man officiating. Ad Clerum Caeſar. Ep.</hi> 63, ſaith, <hi>they go to the Houſe of Prayer, and after the Confeſſion they prepare for the ſinging of Pſalms, ſpeaking of the</hi> firſt Apoſtolical times, <hi>For now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we ſing the</hi> Pſalms <hi>in</hi> parts <hi>or by turns, it ſeems they had not done ſo before, but altogether, View of the New Direct. Ed. fol. p.</hi> 138 In other <hi>Hymns,</hi> 'tis true we read of <hi>Alternate ſinging</hi> more early practis'd. And indeed ſince the Scripture only requires Singing <hi>Pſalms, Hymns, &amp;c.</hi> in general, without preſcribing the particular <hi>mode</hi> of it, Chriſtian Charity ſhou'd make us cautious of cenſuring ſuch different modes of others as <hi>ſinful human Inventions,</hi> except when ſuch an inconvenient <hi>mode</hi> is choſen as excludes the main part of the Congregation from joyning in this Religious Duty.</p>
